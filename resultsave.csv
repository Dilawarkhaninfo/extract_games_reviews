mitnachtKAUBO-I,10,"Hands down my favorite new game of BGG CON 2007.  We played it 5 times in a row -- it's just that good.  Too bad Pandemic won't be in stores until January of 2008.  If you like pure coÃ¶p games (Lord of the Rings, Feurio, etc.), this should be right up your alley.  Having 5 roles to choose from gives the game some extra variability.  Also, once you get good you can ramp up the difficulty by adding more Epidemic cards.  9 -> 10",30549,,0.7783,positive,46,46,3
avlawn,10,"I tend to either love or easily tire of co-op games.  Pandemic joins Knizia's LoTR as my favorite true co-op.  It edges LoTR out merely in time to set-up and play.  LoTR can be an undertaking to explain enough details so that players enjoy their first time through the game, while Pandemic is fast enough that even if the players don't quite get everything that is going on, they can try again immediately.",30549,,0.9536,positive,46,46,3

On the Brink and the fan-made expansion from on ArtsCow add much more variety and good game play, only enhancing an already great game.",30549,,0.9477,positive,46,46,3
cfarrell,10,"Hey! I can finally rate this game I've been playtesting on and off for a couple years. I really like Pandemic, it's the best cooperative game I've played since Lord of the Rings. The key is in the pacing; the game successfully ratchets up the tension as infections spread and outbreaks pop up all over the place, and the players fight a race against time to conquer the various diseases. The game is just a perfect length, about 45 minutes, and the endgame tension is just right - the game doesn't end before it's over. The different roles give the players significantly different prisms through which to look at the game, which is helpful in cleanly driving table-talk and discussion without phony artificial restrictions like Shadows over Camelot had. All in all, this is finally another good cooperative game that gamers can enjoy. It's not as deep as Lord of the Rings, but it's also simpler and shorter and should be accessible to a wide variety of players.  Gamers should probably bypass the ""easy"" game and go straight to the standard game.  If you'd like to tweak the difficulty a little bit without going straight to Heroic level (which can be pretty tough) try starting the infection rate marker on the second or third space.",30549,,0.978,positive,46,46,3

Have played it 2 player with my 5 1/2 year old son (using 4 roles and open hands), and he thinks it is his favorite game now. Played it 3 player with my son and my 8 year old daughter, and it was great too. Also very much enjoyed a solitaire game playing 3 roles. This will definitely be one of the most played games for the next few months. I originally rated this a 9.5, but I can't figure out why I took off half a point.",30549,,0.9894,positive,46,46,3

Noogs,10,"When this game first came out I followed it closely.  I even listened to a Google Talk that the designer of the game gave.  Honestly, I didn't get it.  I couldn't tell if it was just another one of these co-ops that ends up being *essentially* ""Go Fish"" (e.g., Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot).  Also, there were reviewers who were writing that every play was obvious and mechanical.  Well, I played this for the first time at GenCon '09.  Z-Man had sold out by the end of Saturday, so I bought a copy as soon as I got home.  It's that kind of game.  In ease of rules to interesting outcomes, I'd rate it similarly to Ticket to Ride.  The rules are incredibly simple, and very, very tight.  What the rules don't capture, though is that ambiguous dimension of tension.  Some games are able to produce it, some aren't.  Pandemic's the latter.  This was true of a bunch of adults (at GenCon), and has been true with my two daughters (11 and 14).  It's a similar feeling to Twilight Struggle: you never have control over the board, and things can deteriorate very, very quickly.  Me, I like that kind of game, and I'd rank this as the best pure co-op that I've played so far.  Finally, it is simple enough that my daughters have pulled it out on their own when their friends have come over.  I think Z-Man has got a ""classic"" on its hands here.

Some games, we get blasted in 15 minutes while others go right down to the wire and we win or lose by a thread.  Tense, fun and highly addictive.  Since it plays in 45 mins (max), people always want to keep playing until they win.  And everyone who plays with me seems to run out and buy it.

cfarrell,10,"The history of Catan tie-in products has been a little uneven over the years, but a number of them are great; itâ€™s a little funny, but the line really started hitting its stride in the 2010s - about the time most hugely successful product lines would be hitting the point of â€œwell, I guess I need a new boatâ€. I particularly recommend:  Catan Starfarers Rise of the Inkas Game of Thrones Ancient Egypt Explorers & Pirates Seafarers (especially when playing with 3) Fall of Rome Helpers Oil Springs (a novelty, but cheap and super-interesting)  Cities and Knights is a niche flavor for sure, but I find it quite fun. It works well in combination with Seafarers, especially since Seafarers really improves the 3-player game and Cities & Knights is best with 3 or 4. â€”- THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system. --- Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.",13,,0.9985,positive,61,38,1

It looks pretty on the table and gets the attention of folks passing by. - I enjoy the draft-and-pass mechanic to construct your play field.  - scales well for almost any number of players.  Cons: - the cards are a little flimsy and wear.  Can be eliminated by sleeving - but I hate sleeving :) - some of the backs of the cards (age 3) are slightly a different color than others.  Doesn't bother me much, and again can be eliminated by sleeving, but does bother some.   7/20/13 updating to a ten.  This is a great game my whole family enjoys.

Do I want to advance my wonder? Do I want to specialize on a certain card type, or scatter the chances over all colors?

I like efficiency/economic games, and this is a clever little beast which plays quite quickly after you have a couple of games under your belt. Building your deck and getting your engine running, then converting from money to victory points at the right time reminds me of St. Pete and San Juan to some degree, but the gameplay is unique and fascinating. Some deck combinations will have more interaction, while others may have little, but you always will need to watch what other players are doing and how fast the clock is ticking.  The cards are nicely made, the artwork is pleasant, and the infinite combinations will last a long time before anyone truly needs the inevitable expansion decks.

No rules changes, just new cards.  But they blur the vp/income split nicely.  They also add even more interesting decisions during the play of your hand.

I think I've played Race three times since I first played Dominion, and I don't even have ready access to a copy of Dominion!  This is only the third game I've rated a 10, and my first new 10 since the day I joined BGG.  I think it's that good, folks.  The replayability is high, player interaction can be very high (depends on the card sets in use), group-think can be a factor, human psychology can be a factor.  Play with the same set of 10 cards and refine your strategy; switch out just one card for another and it's like a completely different game.  There are 3268760 combinations of decks (25 things, 10 at a time or 25!/(10!*15!)).  If only one tenth of one percent of those possible deck combinations are ""good"" (for some definition of ""good""), that's 3268 different sets.

But more than that, the quickness ensures that there is not one over-arching strategy, that you really do have to adapt to the particular cards in play. This in turn entails a steeper learning curve. I'm in. [But I like Race better.]   ...a year later, in which I've spent a large fraction of my gaming time playing Dominion, (and learned essentially nothing) I'm raising my rating to 10.

A few of the cards are unplayable, but most are well balanced.",36218,,0.9241,positive,43,53,1
jeffwolfe,10,"It can play very differently depending on which cards are in the setup, but even with the same setup, there's usually some room for variety.  With the expansions, there are now lots and lots of cards, but that can be deceptive.  Some cards play very similarly, so that a strategy for one card will work pretty much the same for a similar card.  Example: Village and Mining Village.  But some cards that look very similar end up playing very differently, so it's good to approach each new card with an open mind.  Example: Mine, Remodel, and Upgrade.  It took me a few plays to warm up to this game.  I never disliked it, but it didn't become one of my favorite games immediately.  But it didn't take that long to get there.  I think the best way to learn is the ""First Game"" setup, especially for those who aren't ""gamers"".  Most gamers should do all right going with a different setup, but I don't recommend it.  Once you've learned the game, usually it's best to use a random selection of cards, because then everyone has to adapt to whatever cards come up instead of playing their favorite strategy over and over again.  As more expansions come out, it becomes harder to just do Random 10 from everything, but you can mix and match sets and then go random from that.  I generally don't like lots of Attack cards, but I will play them if the situation calls for it.  Full disclosure: I am a lead playtester.  I became a lead playtester after Seaside came out, but Dominion was my top-rated game long before that.  Note: Aborted game on 2013/02/10 not logged.",36218,,0.9904,positive,43,53,1

spellengek,10,"After several dozen plays, I'm going to adjust my rating to a 10. It's still amazingly replayable and addictive, and doesn't seem to get stale. More variety (with Intrigue) is of course better, but even with only 25 kingdom cards, I can't see myself tiring of Dominion any time soon. ------------------------  Pretty addictive, especially on BSW, where you don't need to shuffle. I prefer the random setup, where you have to find a different combo each time to win. There are lots of combos to explore, but I have the feeling that only a few are really effective. So for the long term, I fear that players of equal (high) experience will tend to make the same choices which cards to buy, so that the shuffle will to a high extent will determine the winner. But I'm happy to be proven wrong. In any case, that's not a stage I have come close to yet.  People keep comparing this with Race for the Galaxy. I can see why, but Dominion doesn't come close to Race in terms of variabilty, versatility and replayability.",36218,,0.9686,positive,43,53,1

Maybe not, but fully engaging to a player choosing to track every detail.    I do think in every way that it is a landmark for the hobby and that was clear from the very beginning. My first set of cards are nearly ragged. And sharing it with my students was a great joy.   The tension can be palpable with some groups, and yet I can play loose with others. I love that range of experience based on my fellow players. Those who say it is all luck fail to regard how you can play your way out of any hand by knowing the game and watching the other players. The best players win much, much more often---but not so much that a new player can't pull a game out.

ditterio,10,"2-8  In Codenames liggen er 25 kaartjes open op tafel. Op elk kaartje staat een woord. Je speelt het spel in twee teams: het blauwe en het rode team. Elk team heeft een leider. Deze leiders zien een raster. Als je leider bent van het blauwe team, dan moet je ervoor zorgen dat jouw team alle kaartjes kan raden die overeenkomen met alle blauwe vakjes in het raster. Als je teamleden ooit het woord kiezen dat overeenkomt met het zwarte kruis, dan is je team meteen verloren. Als leider geef je een tip door een woord en een getal te zeggen, bijvoorbeeld heet 3. Dat wil zeggen dat er (minstens) 3 woorden op tafel liggen die met het woord â€œheetâ€ hebben te maken. De spelers van je team proberen dan deze woorden te vinden. Elke keer als het blauwe team een woord aanduidt dat overeenkomt met een blauwe kleur op het raster, wordt er een blauwe kaart op dat woord gelegd. Het blauwe team scoort nu een punt. Bij een foute gok kan het rode team punten scoren of (nog erger) kan het team meteen verliezen (als het zwarte kruis wordt gekozen).

You can play it solo and simply play through all the different Corporations (cards that give you starting abilities). The game is not so easy to beat but you seem to always get close. You are stuck a little by the luck of the draw on the cards, but there's an area on the board which allows you to do more. Card synergy is great. You can play a series of cards to give you a domino effect. The goal in the solo game is to get the Temperature, Oxygen, and Ocean (water tiles) to a specific level in order to win.

Surya,10,"tl;dr: very good indeed  I played the prototype of this game in late 2014. I quite liked it, but it did still need some work. That came in the form of redoing the turn structure. In the original when it was your turn, you did all your actions. Now you just do one or two actions on your turn and on to the next player. This is a great step forward as it streamlines game play a lot. It makes downtime lower and allows you to think about your actions while other players are at it. What I like a lot about this game is that it offers a huge amount of variety. The amount of unique cards is staggering but there also seems to be a variety of strategies to explore. In our game one player focused on energy and heat. An other player focused on animals and other cards that gave points. I focused on building cities and greeneries. Scores were pretty close. There is a tiny bit of take that in the game, but it's not too bad. The rule book is sometimes a bit confusing, it could have been worded or structured a bit clearer, but in did fall into place pretty nicely when we started playing. Good stuff. Maybe not the 14th best game of all time, but I haven't agreed with a lot of the current top 20 lately. It seems like new games are being over hyped quite a bit. Good games, but THAT good?

I love the theme of the game and I must say that the mechanisms and the card drafting works great.   Now I have the end product and I am really loving this game, one of the best, if not the best game of 2016. ",167791,,0.9841,positive,65,32,1

Nyanapulsar,10,"Very good game! It's a real pleasure to discover the cards during the first plays. The past discovery, you know better the different strategies that you could follow. There are a lot of strategies and every game is different: the draw of the cards, the placement on the board and the different corporations you can represent give a good replayability. The interaction is present with some effects of card, the placement on the board or the claim of the objectives and rewards before the other players. The tension is here. For some aspects, it reminds me Race for the galaxy. It's important to adapt your strategies to the drawing cards and choose your card to keep according to two or three definite strategies, otherwise you can quickly lose yourself. I played it a lot with two players, around 2h30 for a game but it's also a good game with more players. So it's a long game but you don't bother. The rules are not complicated and logic. I really recommend it to all players (except for family) and it can be a good gateway game to heavier games. For just the base game, I give it a 9.  Edit Feb 2020 after several plays with the expansions (except Turmoil): I increase my note to 10. The game becomes replayable to infinity, always challenging but never complicated.",167791,,0.9844,positive,65,32,1

chaddyboy_2000,10,"My 7th 10 rating of all time out of about 1,500 total games played!   I'm a fan of games where you get a selection of cards, and you make the best of what you get, trying to form some sort of engine out of them. This game has it in spades, with a huge number of cards, all of them unique! You're building cities, fostering wildlife, forming seas, founding corporation, starting energy plants, and a ton of other stuff, which all give you various resources and advantages.  As experienced gamers, we just went straight into the full deck of cards, which we really enjoyed. The recommendation for new players is to remove a bunch of cards which seem to have more of an economic/business focus, but I really thought they were interesting would always play with them, even though they make the game a bit longer.  I also really enjoyed that, while I was building an engine, my focus was able to change throughout the game due to all of the things going on. One engine got me to a certain point, at which point another engine became useful, and so on. So, it wasn't an engine building game where you got things up and running and then ran on auto-pilot. You could still find new twists and turns to explore, even as the game neared the end.  Overall, just a really cool game, and I really look forward to more of it!  Regarding the component quality, I've seen complaints, but I really don't get what the concern is. I thought everything was very nice. Yes, the player mats are card stock, but they just sit on the table in front of you and you never move them. Everything was of a quality I'd expect of a modern board game, so no complaints here, and any complaints you see are likely overblown.",167791,,0.9793,positive,65,32,1
Pastor_Mora,10,"El aÃ±o pasado habÃ­a largado con el Terraforming Mars y me habÃ­a dejado la impresiÃ³n de un juego extraordinario. De movida me iba a caer bien, porque soy un fan de la exploraciÃ³n espacial y la ciencia ficciÃ³n ""realista"", y para el diseÃ±o del HÃ¡bitat Espacial pude estudiar muchas de las teorÃ­as detrÃ¡s de cada cartas que aparecen en el Terraforming Mars.  TenÃ­a tantas opciones para explorar y una engine de cartas con tanto espacio para el pro-play que me reservÃ© comentarlo porque sentÃ­a que tenÃ­a que conocerlo mÃ¡s.  Un aÃ±o despuÃ©s, ya con varias partidas encima, en el Ficus y en solitario, creo que es el momento de revisar si el juego estÃ¡ a la altura de las primeras impresiones. Cha cha cha chaaaaaaaannnn *suspenso*  Una de las dudas que me surgiÃ³ fue la capacidad de especializaciÃ³n. Si bien terraformar un planeta es un proceso complejo que tiene muchas aristas, no me atraÃ­a la idea de que todos terminÃ¡ramos ""haciendo lo mismo en distinto orden"", como pasa en muchos euros. En este juego esperaba un costado mÃ¡s temÃ¡tico, que hiciera brillar las capacidades asimÃ©tricas de las distintas corporaciones.  En este sentido, el juego cambia completamente de acuerdo al nÃºmero de jugadores, porque el objetivo final de terraformar el planeta no escala para nada, y creo que por ahÃ­ es un elemento de diseÃ±o que le faltÃ³, pero es opinable.  El resultado es que cuando son pocos jugadores, cada jugador tiene mÃ¡s turnos, y baja mÃ¡s cartas, y termina haciendo mÃ¡s cosas, y al final, se diluye un poco ""la"" especializaciÃ³n en diversas especializaciones. Por supuesto, con menos jugadores las engines son enormes y tremendamente potentes, algo que sin duda resulta atractivo.  Por otro lado, cuando son mÃ¡s jugadores, la especializaciÃ³n tiene mÃ¡s personalidad, porque en menos turnos no se puede ser tan abarcativo, y temÃ¡ticamente creo que le suma.  De todos modos, un elemento fundamental para lograr esa especializaciÃ³n es contar con cierto control sobre las cartas que te llegan, y la mecÃ¡nica bÃ¡sica del juego en ese sentido tiene una alta dosis de azar. Creo que para lograr el efecto temÃ¡tico de especializaciÃ³n hay que encararlo con mÃ¡s jugadores y con la variante del drafteo de cartas, para tener mÃ¡s control.  Si por el contrario, buscÃ¡s un euro power-builder con increÃ­ble profundidad, encararlo con menos jugadores es suficiente y el drafteo menos necesario.  De cualquier modo, Terraforming Mars sigue siendo un tÃ­tulo que recibe mi mayor recomendaciÃ³n y hasta donde mi experiencia lo indica, es sin duda el mejor juego complejo lanzado en 2016.",167791,,-0.8885,negative,65,32,1

There are so many cards, and combinations of Corporations and cards, that each game is different. UPDATE 2: 30 plays now and I appreciate the game as much as ever. I think the first expansion with the double-sided board is a must to keep the game fresh after the first dozen or so plays. The other expansions are all good, but far from essential.

This ""gem"" is the expected positive surprise from the 2016/17 gaming season! Including exploring, development (on player board (own company) and main game board (Mars)), tile placement and drafting elements. The right decision on the right time is a huge factor. Deciding between one action or two following action on your turn is important to be succesful as well looking at your opponents possible strategies and developments!  We played over three hours (with new players) but we diddn't had any feel of lenghts, nobody was looking any time at the clock..., everybody is involved and excited what will happen on the board, which development the current player will reveal! You could not really plan what to do next, because you have to react too, but to be succesful (winning the game) you have to follow ""your"" strategie. Concentrade on your strength but everytime open to change in favour to the new revealed project cards and opportunities given by the turns from your opponents before. This game is till now a real 10! (And we haven't dicovered the whole game till now!)  Added expansions... Added Promos... Added extra set of resources... Added Overlays in five colors...

4Corners,10,"Very thematic worker placement game, with excellent scalability and good variability, about building the best farm.  It's hard to believe that such a strategic ""gamer's game"" could be so accessible to the average non-gamer, and that it's designed by Uwe Rosenberg of all people (of Bohnanza fame).  This is a game that once played, people want to immediately play it again.  Despite the fact that the main mechanism is worker placement, which is getting overly tired these days, the game still feels fresh, as it has a very unique and strong theme.  Plus the huge amount of cards (occupation, which add special abilities/skills, and minor improvements, which again add special abilities) adds variability.  It should be noted that the cards are not nearly as crucial to gameplay as one would think.  I have bitched and moaned practically every game I've played about my terrible starting hand, and won most of those games without the need to play hardly any cards (although I would hope that having and playing a lot of strong cards is a viable strategy- edit: it is, as I've even won by playing a lot of crap cards).  The components are very good (particularly if you have the animeeples, which I do), the scalability is excellent, and the game, while lasting 14 rounds, goes by very quickly and gives you a lot to think about during and after the completion of the game.  It's all about balance, balance, balance, as points are awarded (or deducted) for essentially every possible category in the game (3 different animal types, vegetables, grain, pastures, fields, stables, family members, filled/empty spaces, buildings, cards, etc.).  If ever a ""gamer's game"" is to become mainstream, and break through to the masses, this is that game.  I've recently noticed this for sale at Indigo/Chapters, which is a real positive sign (they've expanded their zone beyond Settlers and Carcassonne).  Edit: Agricola is long gone from those shelves, looks like the herd weren't up to the challenge after all, too bad.

autumnweave,10,"This is essentially a puzzle solving game.  The more you play the better you get at solving the puzzle or optimizing your moves.  After 39 plays the shine still hasn't come off.  I think that getting the right draw of cards is significant in determining whether or not you're the winner, but more important is getting your food engine up and running.  This is a game which can appear daunting to people who have just played lighter games, but is fairly intuitive.  One of the nice things about this game is that it is a very strong 2 player game.  I play with my wife a lot, and she enjoys it as the flow seems to make sense and relate to how a farm would work.  After 13 plays I'm willing to concede that I may bump it up.  But I hate to bump it up, burn out, and then move it back down.  11/25/08 Bumped it up to a 9 as I'm playing this game a lot.  03/28/09 I think that I enjoy 5 players less than a fewer number of players.

Barkam,10,"Aug-08-2008 First four games.  Wow!  Just wow!  This game is so much fun.  The game is so enthralling I don't notice the time go by.  The game has so many hard decisions to make as you try to do/get everything to have the most well rounded farm.  The game is a great combination of so many mechanics found in great games, yet this one provides a very different experience.  It really is hard to put into words.  This is the only action placement game that I actually like.  Games like Leonardo Da Vinci, Caylus, Age of Empires III are abysmal compared to this game.  It is really cool how the game changes so much between the family game and between each regular game.  It is a cool feeling of finding your niche among other farmers and seeing your desolated land develop to a prosperous farm.  How a few rounds ago your land is half empty and by the end of the game it is ""complete.""  Agricola is a great combination of theme and mechanics that fall in the meaty category.  Mind kind of game. Initial Rating: 9  Aug-31-2008 After 45 games I think it is time reward the game a 10.  Even though I have played the game 45 times, I still want to play it back to back to back to back... You get the idea.  This game embodies the 10 rating.  I love playing this game with new players and experienced players a like.  I like the feeling of playing against other people and playing against the game at the same time since you have so little time to do so many things.  Kind of like the same feeling you get from playing Antiquity.  The cards are what make this game so great.  They provide the avenue for the game to become strategic as they give you incentives to follow specific strategic paths.  The cards prevent the game from being a tit-for-tat game and from being a purely tactical game.  Actually, I think the underlying skill needed to play Agricola well is to gauge how much use you can get from the occupations and improvements.  You will find that a lot of the cards are awesome to play but you have to focus on only a few of them or you'll find yourself doing too many things at the same time and thus not getting much use from your awesome cards.  The person that can do this best will win the game.  Additionally, I am happy to report that I haven't played a game where my hand of minor improvements and occupations made me feel like I was doomed.  The game actually moves in a pretty quick pace.  Obviously if you play with AP people then it would take longer.  I typically play 4 player games in under 90 minutes.  Additional to the cards, the game has so much replayability because the game changes character when playing the game with different numbers of players.  For example in 4 player games it is easy to get ovens because there is an action that gives you reed, stone and food.  It is easy to setup a grain food engine.  In contrast with a 2 player game, there is no reed, stone & food action so it takes a bit longer to get the stone for the ovens.  Also, occupations are slower to play in 2 player games compared to 4 player games because in 2 player games there is only 1 occupation action versus 2 in 4 player games.  You really have to reorient yourself when playing the game with different numbers of players.  It is liken to hitting a wall.

An endless quest for a repeat of that sensation experienced during the exciting discovery of a new elegant game that I want to play over and over. After my first play, I chalked this one up as a nicely designed worker placement. But after a few more games I found that the variability in card driven strategy begs for more plays and attempts at improved optimization. That said, I find that games with 4 or more players can drag esp with those prone to AP. I like it best with two or three. All in all a fantastic game that has broad appeal for a relatively deep game. The hype is justified.",31260,,0.9879,positive,59,40,1

thoia,10,"OK I broke my Agricola cherry last night and it is a great game. Does it deserve to be a 10? I'm not sure, it took Puerto Rico a long time to get there and I never award a 10 right away and certainly not after 1 game so we'll see where this one goes. Tough, very tough decisions to be made in this game from start to finish.  One thing I will strongly say about this game is that they did something very different than a lot of other games. Most games would come out and shortly thereafter release expansions fairly quickly. I feel like the various decks ARE the expansions and it's nice to have bought a game and feel like I've already been given the expansions and can look forward to many many months of game play.   UPDATE: After 36 plays in a relatively short amount of time I find myself wanting to play Agricola more and more. This game kicks ass all over the place. Hype is one thing but this game lives up to it.  UPDATE: I play this game all the time and well didn't even  start recording plays until about 40 had gone by...still not getting old. This is certainly a sign that this is a truly GREAT game.    UPDATE: Well over 100 plays now and I still love this game. That's the mark of a truly great game if you ask me. I teach this game to new players using standard (non-family) rules and using all 4 decks...yes even Z. New players get the full load when I teach and as a result I can count 2 who have literally purchased the game the day after I taught it. (Certainly more bought it after learning but those took longer than 1 day!)  This game's ability to scale with number of players means it's great at any number. People will have their favorite sweet spots but the board and cards both scale so well it shines no matter what and always feels like you are playing Agricola not matter what.

Glamorous Mucus,10,"Yes, yes, YES!  The sadists weep because the masochists have all gone off to play Agricola, and who can blame them - being punched in the face never felt so good.  Simply freaking exhilarating.  You will know that your own special moment in history has arrived the first time you feed your family clay for dinner, because your Farm-Fu is so powerful.  Agricola is the bee's knees and the D's Bs (or perhaps the Wildschwein's Bs?).  Why does Agricola excite me while outwardly similar games like Caylus, The Pillars of the Earth and Leonardo da Vinci do not?  Two reasons.  First and most importantly, Agricola has drama. It hurls you into a burning house and locks the doors from the outside. You're doomed, but the prettiest corpse wins. There is simply not enough time to do what you need to do, so you merely do what you can. Through its sheer brutality, it creates the tension and urgency that I didn't find in other games from its genre. Agricola makes me feel like I'm walking a knife's edge, and what might be a small tactical decision in other games could lead to ruin here. How thematically appropriate, as well!  Secondly, Agricola manages to create a different game experience every time you play, on a level far beyond almost any other so-called Euro. Every game offers a unique set of challenges and opportunities because of your hand of 14 cards, chosen from a set of hundreds. The designer Uwe Rosenberg has taken a page from the Anglo-American school of game design here, adopting the variety, chaos, and rule-breaking powers of games like Cosmic Encounter and Magic: The Gathering. It's a welcome breath of fresh air in a German game market that has been growing a little stale in recent years.",31260,,0.9805,positive,59,40,1

Chuck Singer,10,"This will probably be a 10 for me.  You gain victory points for building up your farm the best.  The more children you have the more actions you can take in a game turn but the more food you will need to feed all the hungry family members.  Actions are selected like they are in caylus so this game will be compared to that one a lot, but I more see the game as likened to Princes of Florence.  You are dealt a starting hand of farm improvements and occupations and the way to win is to best utilize these cards to fit your engine, much like in PoF you have to make the most victory points out of how your cards fit together.  The crazy thing about this game is that there are so many cards that no two games should feel the same.  This may be its only drawback as well, as certain card combinations will most likely lead to certain victory - but time shall tell.",31260,,0.9899,positive,59,40,1

Alan Kwan,10,"A worthy game for the innovative turn-sequence system alone - and there's more.  The game also combines the ""multiple paths to victory"" as in Princes of Florence, and the ""break normal game rules"" aspect of some CCGs (or Cosmic Encounter, Ursuppe/Urland etc.) in the form of purple building functions.  (And yes, the buildings can be very powerful.)  And yet the balance between the various game elements (building costs etc.) seems to be just right, so that there is no single obvious winning strategy (at least it seems so) nor elements which become useless because they're too weak.  A most excellent, finely-crafted game.  Perhaps the best of 2002, my bet for DSP winner.",3076,,0.9432,positive,58,41,1

He is a single father (divorced from a woman who is in and out of jail/prison for drug use), so we advised him that he do something that they could share in as a family. We suggested to the nephew to try playing board games. The son said he did not like board games, but we convinced him to try one he had never played (Ticket to Ride). They both enjoyed it. The second game we tried was Splendor. The nephew really enjoyed it...but the son LOVED it.  They borrowed our old copy of the game and wore it out over the summer of 2021. (My wife happily replaced it with a new copy.) The son even taught it to his high school buddies. They have played it over and over and over.

We played 8 times--2 tournaments of best of 5.    4-14-14-Ordered from White Dragon Enterprises.  Maf is the one who mentioned it first and it looks like a lot of fun.  She describes it as a stripped down engine builder.  ,148228,,0.9325,positive,79,20,0

Zooboo,10,"Many people compare Splendor with Sid Sackson's Bazaar.  I own both games and beside the fact that they share the same theme,  they don't have much in common.  Splendor shares more similarities with his big brother St Petersburg.  Their mechanics are similar,  but Splendor is shorter (10-15 minutes per player) and is easier to learn.  It has the potential to appeal to non-gamers like mom and dad... and is still challenging for gamers. The material is gorgeous and handling those heavy tokens is really a pleasure.  Splendor is slowing raising among my top gateway games and deserves a permanent place in my collection. ",148228,,0.9913,positive,79,20,0

This is a simple but elegant engine building game with cool thick poker chip components that represent various precious gems.  The Renaissance European styled art fits the overdone ""trading luxury goods in the Mediterranean region"" quite nicely but the gameplay is solid and simple to teach and difficult to master.

pdrseuss,10,"I'm amused at what this game is not. Scythe is purely not a worker placement, not a 4X game, not a war-game, not a race to 6 stars/objectives, not an engine-builder, not an area control game, not a trading-in-the-Mediterranean game, not a resource management game. . . , YET, it has a wonderful blend of all of it!! Even the stuff I'm not fond of (i.e. area contol), I love in this game!  Yup! This game hits me just right! Once you start playing, things start clicking. The theme shines through without being annoying, mostly because of the beautiful artwork and the thoughtful alternate-historical details. Learning curve, but an engaging one I hope. Much replayability. Games can go fast once players know what's going on. Perhaps some downtime, thus AP alert, but this can help when people need the off-time to figure out their plans. Many strategic and tactical decisions. Very decent 2-player, but the game changes a bit as the board fills up more with more players.  Reminds me a little of Nexus Ops and Antike. I don't believe it's as heavy as people say. Though people are complaining that the starting conditions for each player spoon-feed you on the strategy you need to follow, I don't feel that to be a negative for me because I still need to work any strategy around what others are doing in order to win; that is, I'm still using my brain and creativity, and still having fun.   I can't wait to try out the Automa, and the expansion(s).",169786,,0.9844,positive,79,20,0

Tinkerhd,10,"My 25th play was my first with a production copy. The gameplay was already top notch, and the fantastic production seals my love for it. More a euro with the ever present threat of war than a true waro. Saving military victories for the endgame is an important strategic consideration. However, you could beat each other to death with this game if your group were into that sort of thing. The heart of the game is in the way its structures interaction between players. The map and tech progression work together to create a watchful but safe early game for getting an engine going. The midgame sees players crossing out of their own territories to rub elbows on the mainland. Then the end game sees players either rushing for safe ground or chaotically clashing in battle to place last stars and expand. I have wanted one game to fill that Euro Trash niche. This is it. And my fancy version is easily the prettiest game I've ever played. Is it the best game? One of them, but not quite ""the game."" It's going to be my go-to for a lot of guests.

This is one of my favorite games right now. I look forward to playing it many more times over the years. July 2016  Returned rating to a 10. I've played 6 solo games, which is pushing it back up for me. I don't usually care about solo gaming that much, but with my limited time lately, it's nice to be able to knock out a game in the evening in about 90 minutes including setup and breakdown. August, 2016.  I'm still in love with this game. I haven't been able to play for over a month, but still have TWENTY NINE plays so far this year (that's just from late July through late October!). Solo mode has been great. I've also been solo-testing a campaign I've designed, playing 4-player games by myself. I've gotten a ton of use out of this, and I truly regret not going all-in on the Kickstarter. I've ordered the metal coins, and maybe someday I'll get the realistic resources.

Alan Stern,10,"I absolutely love this game!  It strikes an excellent balance between planning (strategy) and response (tactics).  I like how the combat/pvp nature of the game is well balanced - there is such a dual-edged nature to combat that players think long and hard before committing to them and it can be strategically advantageous to eat a loss rather than over commit and obtain a victory.  In addition (and this is for games of 3+ players), you have to consider how winning 1 combat weakens your overall ability to defend yourself and opens you up to combat from other players.  It really is well done.  I also like the engine building.  It's not a complicated engine, but the operations required to establish the engine and utilize it are varied enough that players have many choices to make.  In addition, those choices tend to be very deep - they are the tip of the iceberg, a snowball that may or may not lead to the ultimate goal (global world domination or something like that).  It's the depth of gameplay that keeps me coming back.  I like the dual nature of upgrades.  You uncover a benefit and cover a cost.  It's such a nice way of offering compelling, meaningful choices with real consequences.  The variance in starting position/mats is fantastic!  The combination of faction + player mat makes for some real differences in terms of the best strategy to utilize.  And then you have to consider the goals, which may or may not be worth pursuing.  Plenty of choices!  I love the art in this game.  Pastoral and very thematic.  The illustrations help frame the game in a larger context.  It wasn't strictly necessary, and not everyone likes or enjoys it, but I think it adds character to the bigger package and presentation.  Production value is excellent!  Even the base game is high quality.  The additional pieces (metal coins, board extension, realistic resource tokens) are much appreciated!  I strongly recommend using glass markers/beads in place of the cardboard exploration tokens.  The cardboard tokens get lost among the board's colorful artwork.  3d beads are *MUCH* easier to see and improve gameplay.  My primary criticism is that games will often end with an unequal number of turns.  This is something that [u][url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23299059#23299059]I discussed in the forums[/url][/u].  I have two ""answers"" for this point.  My first inclination, as suggested by sethvanorden in that thread, is to use turn order as a handy cap modifier.  Very easy and very understandable.  My second thought is to give a small compensation to those players who received one less turn - an award on the order of 5 coins or so.  Small, insufficient, but enough to reduce the sting and say ""I feel your pain but I'm not giving you 100% insurance coverage.""  I think either or both of those will help.  Overall, this is just a fantastic game.  I think there's enough depth to keep me interested for a long time without overwhelming players.  Also, the play time hits a sweet, [i]sweet[/i] spot - 2 hours once people are familiar.  There are potential swings and not everything is 100% balanced, but it shouldn't be.  This is not a pure abstract - it's a thematic euro.  You want it unbalanced enough to provide options, but not so off-kilter that the whole system wobbles out of control.  And it hits that spot beautifully.  Try it.  [gameid=169786] may or may not be your cup o' tea, but I'd give it better than even odds that you see and appreciate at least some of its carefully crafted beauty.",169786,,0.9988,positive,79,20,0

It's very easy to teach, and players can play for the win from game #1.  This has quickly become one of my favorite games, although I'm curious to it's staying power in the long run.

Camel,10,"Based on several plays I must say I'm impressed. Days of Wonder have always been one of my favorite game companies when in comes to high-end quality components (regarding both the creativity and quality of these) and story-enhancing elements (you actually PLAY and make up stories when you play their game, instead of just trying to win), and this is no exception. So even though they might ""just"" have picked up an old game (""Vinci"", which I have actually never played) and copied the mechanics almost completely down to the last detail, they have done so masterfully. Definitely a must have for the collection. The expansions just makes it even more perfect",40692,,0.9638,positive,67,31,2

cayluster,10,"When this was first announced, I thought it was a must-have, and almost pre-ordered it.  After reading some more and considering, I changed my mind about it.  And it stayed changed until my birthday, when I got it along with Cavum and La Citta.  I don't know why I resisted for so long.  Worried it would be too simple?  Turned off by the juvenile fantasy theme?  Maybe.  But the fact of the matter is, Small World is great.  Amazingly addictive, the playing time hits a sweet spot (45min-1hr).  And I always want to play it - it never gets old, thanks to the myriad possible race/abilities combo.  It's one of those rare games that is both a lot of fun, pretty to look at, and easy to learn while at the same time being quite deep.  I'm even into the theme and the races - it's all good, clean, fun that couldn't be juvenile if it tried, simply because the game behind the theme is so good.  Scales amazingly.  Has one of the best inserts out there - it's obvious DoW takes much care with their work.  Seriously, if you don't own this game, go out and buy it.

mcannos,10,"Tons of conflict, good for 2-5, very pretty, close finishes, hard decisions, diplomacy, replayability, comedy theme - though rather fiddly. The lack of balance is marked in 2 player games, but in 3-5 - look out if you get what is perceived as a killer attacking combo: you're going to get pounded! Great family game, good laughs.  Picked it up cheap on iPad; eliminates fiddliness but the AI is weak; it is totally inept against an aggressive opponent and it is essentially trivial to win games by scorelines of about 100-60 by going on all-out attack. Update to Small World 2 pretty great; still easy in 2-player but gets more challenging and thinky with more players, because the aggressive approach described above collapses. Have upgraded my rating to 10 on replayability of app; have played hundreds of games against the computer as a few minute timekiller, and I still enjoy it.",40692,,0.9751,positive,67,31,2

It fixes all of my issues with the above and takes the game from taxing to fun.  Silly how a simple thing can make such a big change.",40692,,0.9432,positive,67,31,2

kevinb9n,10,"This is probably the best Ticket to Ride game. And the outcome is more likely to be skill-based than with regular TTR.  The ferries are cool because the increase the value of locomotive cards, which in turn increases the value of taking face-down draws. This makes your drawing decisions a little more interesting.  The tunnels tend to mitigate the advantage of drawing many overlapping tickets, since these overlapping tickets will be likely to pass through the central tunnel-infested regions. However, they also inject a hearty dose of randomness into the game which I don't think is really needed.  The stations are great. The best thing about them is that they allow you to really live on the edge of the knife with your ticket draws, which makes the game more fun.  Having all the tickets be 12 points or under, except for a single long ticket you get at the start of the game, is another change for the better. Regular TTR does suffer from some insanely lucky ticket draws you can make.  >20 plays counting F2F only.  Hundreds counting on-line, PC and xbox. ",14996,,0.9865,positive,66,32,2

Lawster,10,"Beautiful tiles. Enjoyable abstract. I like that the game is as much about outthinking your opponents as playing your own board. Definitely keep an eye on what tiles other players need, and factor that into your tile selection. Great tactical strategy about when to select tiles from the middle to change the order of who may get stuck with leftover tiles at the end of the round. Sometimes foisting negative points on other players is just as helpful in terms of end game score outcomes. Also, this game plays well at all player counts. Two-player is great since it's a different strategy than higher player counts due to likely only going through the tile bag once if you stick to 5 rounds. I added an additional bag to my box, so that used tiles go right in the 2nd bag each round. Speeds things up. Also, this game plays great with kids. If needed, you can modify the game for younger players by not having floor tiles count against them. That way they can just focus on the strategy and not get moody about taking negative points. Once the kids start beating you regularly, then you know that they are ready for the regular rules.",230802,,0.9756,positive,70,27,0

Kiesling has an incredible ability to design games that have a concise and simple set of rules but have a ton of depth in the strategy and game play.  Azul epitomizes this.  Azul is so simple to remember all the rules, teach the rules, and get to the table.  Yet everytime I play I experience a new moment.  Its a game I can teach someone who has never played a modern board game in their life as well as enjoy playing with the heaviest and most discerning gamers.  I have around 12 plays under my belt and not a single one of those plays did I lose any love for this game.  ",230802,,0.9758,positive,70,27,0

So much crammed in to about 45 minutes, I wish I could have played it again right after. A few more plays of this I could see this jumping to a 9 as it is that good.

Try to find the strategy and tactics to win, only to be smacked down by a giant cyber bunny. Kids love this. Best with 3 or more players, though some fun 2 player variants are very good. I'm really liKING this, when initially I expected to think it would be a mediocre game just for kids.  Family Game. Church group game. Beer-and-Pretzels Game.

It has player elimination, often before you've even played a card. It offers few choices, let alone meaningful ones. But I've already played it 25 times, and I don't think I'm ever going to get tired of teaching it to a new group (in 30 seconds) and seeing them erupt into hilarity within a minute flat. Pure joy in an envelope.   [Brief note on versions: I prefer the art and rules of the Japon Brand original, but others favour the AEG version in one or both aspects.

dougadamsau,10,"The princess is upset.  Players are suitors, trying to get the palace staff to deliver your consoling love letter to the princess.  Quirky Japanese game, played with a deck of sixteen cards.  Each card is numbered between 1 (Guard) and 8 (Princess).  There are multiple copies of several cards.  One card is dealt out of the round, face down, and one card is dealt to each player - this is their hand.  On their turn, the player draws a card, adds it to their hand, then discards one of their two cards.  The discarded card must be actioned.  Each card's action interacts with the other players in some way - the Guard's action names another player and a character, knocking that player out of the round if they deduce the character correctly.  To win a round, you have to be the last one standing, or hold the highest value card when the round ends.  To win the game, you have to win a pre-determined number of rounds.  Totally insane, more bluff and luck than tactical, but works very well as a ten minute filler.  Better with 3 or 4, but still fun with 2 players.  Great stocking stuffer for Xmas.  Having now played several games of the Japanese version, I think the Japanese rules are better and make for a more interesting game.",129622,,0.991,positive,73,20,0

Jim Marshall,10,"Very short, very neatly designed card game that plays in less than 20 minutes.  Very dependant on card draw, in that you can quickly be out of a hand through one of the other players playing one of the 'gotcha!' cards, but at this super-short play time it's not an issue. ---------- The more I play this (43 plays and counting), the more I am impressed by the situations and challenges it throws up in a 3 minute round with 15 cards in play.

Fribian,10,"Really great game! I enjoy this game a lot. I guess you get to be a bird grower. You play bird cards in 4 different regions (using food to play them). Hatch eggs, draw new cards. The deck is thick thick fat fat! 170 bird cards in the base game and every bird is different.   What I liked:  - Great meeples, cards, dice, and player mats - The theme is very good and I loved the Bird House - Birds on the cards are really neat, and I kinda feel like I learn something about birds - The automa for solo play is really slick - Love the engine building and bird card synergy  - No two bird cards are alike, and the cards have really interesting abilities on them which could have incredible ability to chain their powers depending on how you played them on the player mat.  - The game sets up fast and plays fast once you've got a handle on the game. For as complex a game as it is, you can play a few games in a night.  - This is a great game for care bears as there are no direct attacks. The only thing care bears might not like is opponents can take birds that you might have wanted. The thing that mitigates this a bit is the End Game Goal cards. It would mostly likely happen in the End Round Goal tiles. - Playing the normal game is not easy to beat, so there's a challenge there for a long time. You can play easier game if you like winning a lot (but still might not win against the Automa all the time in Eaglet mode)  What I didn't like:  - I had difficulty getting my head around the automa rules, and had to look online a bit to get it figured out. The rule book really isn't that bad, it's just comprehension mostly on my part.  - I found myself fumbling with getting the dice into the back of the birdhouse. However, it wouldn't look as cool if the birdhouse didn't have a top on it, or it had a huge hole on the side of it.  - I don't like tucking the cards behind the other cards much. It's hard to get them underneath when other bird cards are adjacent, plus I worry I might tweak the edge of the cards while trying to lift them. - The little plastic trays could use improvement. I found them very frustrating to put back together, so I didn't. I just stacked them inside the box. I feel like replacing them with some of my own but they do stack OK and I had room for everything in the box plus a bird nest I bought to pimp the game a little.  ",266192,,0.9906,positive,82,16,1

WiIIPower18,10,"It seems to me that the biggest complaint people seem to have about this game is that they want it to be something that it is not. If you want a game with ""take-that"" elements then this isn't what you are looking for. If you don't like the bird theme well obviously you've once again found the wrong game. If you want a game where you have ample time to do every single thing you want in one play then this probably will not appeal to you. What makes this game great is the fact that you have a ton you want to accomplish and it is very unlikely you can manage to get them all done. The only other complaints I've seen have simply not been true in my plays of the game. One is that the final round is nothing but laying eggs. Only one of my six plays have I spent more than one action on laying eggs in the final round. Eggs are points so I'm sure this does happen on occasion to be the only logical move but assuming it would occur in every play would be short sited in my opinion. The other criticism I've seen is that many birds have different art but similar if not exactly the same effect on them. While I see the validity in this criticism I see the reasoning for having the same action on multiple cards. Having 170 different actions while great for variety would likely make balance a nightmare from a design standpoint. in my opinion this game 100% accomplishes what it sets out to do in style and it has easily become one of my favorite games.",266192,,0.9628,positive,82,16,1

raptorb,10,"What to rate Wingspan? It wasn't quite what we expectedâ€”it's much closer to Race for the Galaxy with light engine building than Terraforming Mars. Some plays you can get a key bird in early and have its power fire multiple times, but other plays you might build an engine that fires once, if at all. We're enjoying playing the game on the blue side of the scoring sheet, as the competitive green side kind of ruins the zen.  And it is zen. I would play this anytime, anywhere. It's relaxing, and closer to solitaire, but still rewards planning ahead, and the right engine at the right time can really pay off.  Is it the perfect game? Maybe not, but the production could fool you. And then there are the BIRDS, the stars of the show. Full disclosure, I'd be hard pressed to name a theme more exciting than birds (THEY ARE LIVING DINOSAURS). One of my dream themes is bird migration, so... Anyway, any designer or publisher willing to champion a game with a fresh theme should be commended (no more trading in the Mediterranean, I beg you). I'd love to see Wingspan lead a wave of unique themes.  I'm so happy to have this game in our collection. It's the perfect game to pull out on a weeknight and relax with.

revengeisnotjustice,10,"Dixit is certainly a party game.  If you don't like party games, you won't like Dixit.  Occasionally, I love a good party game, one that requires abstract thinking and creativity.  Dixit is a game that lets each player's creativity shine by asking the players to see many aspects the beautifully illustrated images.  Dixit requires serious out of the box thinking, and it can take time to get used to the idea of the game.  The rules are simple to learn, but it's hard to wrap your mind around the best way to play.    I think the depth of the images leads to a lot of replayability.  Each time I take out the cards to look at them, I find more little details that I hadn't noticed before.  The number one reason to play Dixit is for the art, for the little details that make each card its own work of art; it's good that the game play is about the art or the cards would completely upstage the gameplay.    I love the first moments of a game with people who have never played because when everyone looks at their first hand of cards, I can see how enchanted everyone is by the fabulous artwork.  That's exactly how I felt when I first picked up Dixit in the store to read the back of the box.  I had no idea what the game was about, but I knew I was going to go home and find out because if the game was even half as good as the artwork, I knew it would be a lot of fun to play.  Luckily, it is as fun to play as it is beautiful. ",39856,,0.9973,positive,85,14,1

kerning,10,"Absolutely enchanting! There are very, very few party games I enjoy or games that are this light, but this is a winner!  This game is simply gorgeous. The art is delightful--whimsical, dream-like, surreal, vibrant, and charmingly amateur (in a good way--it has child-like wonder and expressiveness that really goes well with the simplified figures and forms). They are abstract-ish enough that a good many ""stories"" could be told based on their imagery.  The scoring is simple here but nicely considered. In similar games (like Apples to Apples, or Loaded Questions), play often degenerates into senselessness when players begin to match the oddest things or make up answers quite unlike what they may normally say to ""sabotage"" each other. In Dixit, you can neither be too abstract nor too specific; all or no votes for your story, phrase, or word results in 0 points, forcing you to strike a nice balance.  As someone in a creative industry, I really appreciate this game. That said, you need the appropriate people to enjoy this one, people with imagination and adequate articulation.",39856,,0.9957,positive,85,14,1

BennyD,10,":d10-2:  Yep, this one has more depth than I had thought upon first glance. After the first two plays, I had a suspicion that there was more to be seen. And on plays three and four, I saw it.  The economics of the game works out that tile prices are basically balanced around six costs/benefits:  1) Button cost, i.e. VP cost 2) Time cost, i.e. finite resource equal between players 3) Tempo cost, i.e. actions given up to the other player in order to do this particular action 4) Button gain, i.e. regular source of VPs which rewards early investment 5) Spatial coverage, i.e. one time VP gains 6) Shape irregularity, i.e. loss of chance at bonus VPs and/or potential spatial coverage  All of these concerns interact with one another in interesting ways. BUT, the [i]one[/i] cost that can be entirely negated with good play is #6. Shape irregularity. If you plan to get the exactly fitting pieces and place them correctly, you can gain more of the other benefits while skirting the typical costs associated. This means that the more advanced you get, the more the geometry of the game takes center stage. Thus, a game that seems to be a cute, light economic engine game becomes a brain puzzling spatial organization test paired with a savagely clever turn order and tile opportunity dance.  I really want to play this well.",163412,,0.9915,positive,82,18,0

Phil Bordelon,10,"A beautiful, amazing game.  The tension between button costs and time costs is fantastic, the way turns work is amazing, and... basically, everything about this game is great.  It's appealing on an aesthetic level and it's appealing on a nerdy bin-packing uber-Tetris level.  I love that there's nothing random after the opening setup, too.  True story: about three turns into my very first game of this, I thought ""wow, I think I'm in love"".  Subsequent plays haven't proven me wrong.",163412,,0.9822,positive,82,18,0

Torquin,10,"Finally played it...and loved it. I must admit that I really like some of the older titles by Stefan Feld, especially Im Jahr Des Drachen and Notre Dame, and this game has the same addictive quality. It took a little time to remember all the possible player actions and special powers (even though they are all referenced by tiny illustrations on the player boards), but after that the game played really smoothly. And instead of pain (a trademark of Stefan's older games), this game gives you so many options to obtain points that it really makes you greedy. Liked it a lot with three players, would like to try with two. UPDATE: Played with two and loved it the same as with three. While playing, I am fully aware of the fact that I am enjoying myself a great deal. And the dice just make this game highly replayable. Magic. UPDATE: Played this game ten times now, and have enjoyed it every single time. Don't expect this to change in the future - apparently, this game offers everything I enjoy at just the right levels of complexity and game length.

pyr-shep,10,Another great game from Stefan Feld. Plays best with 2. Good with 3. Do not play this with 4!  What I like about this game: - only 2 actions each turn; but with clever use you can get more actions. - each tile you buy has an advantage. Lots of choices; what tile to buy? Will I go for points or a tile that alters the rules? - tension in being first to get bonus points. - the rounds plays pretty fast. Not a lot of downtime.

This game does have very little player interaction so it makes for the perfect 2 player experience.

It is a mix of strategic play, psychological understanding of your opponents and screwing them at the same time and I have to admit that for me it is very difficult to win but the FUN compensates every play.

All of those elements are things that really excite me when it comes to games, and so dress it up with some wonderful artwork and those yummy looking gold tokens and it is just a winner for me.

Kodeir,10,"Race for the Galaxy is a great example of how to craft a solid game based on snowball economies and optimization: add extensive doses of deduction.  Each turn players simultaneously and secretly choose an action. All players have access to the same pool of actions, and the one who picks each of them perform it with a bonus, but the rest of the players will be able to perform it too. Actions which aren't picked by any player are skipped for that round. This forces players to create efficient engines which not only run on their own, but also can benefit from the other player's actions, while simultaneously benefiting their opponents as little as possible. Players not only work with their own engine in their heads: they must keep everyone else's engine in mind.  This makes most interactions subtle and indirect, as there is no way of directly affecting your opponents. Yet it's not a ""multiplayer solitaire"", as truly efficient play on the one hand requires extensive deduction, and on the other setting up and engine that can benefit from the phases other players are reliant on.  Also, the fact that each card can either be used by itself or as a resource makes every draw valuable, and hand management presents the player with interesting decisions to be made at all times. Thus, luck not only is mitigated, but it's done so in a way that makes managing it very engaging.  The game's biggest flaw is its learning curve, which is stupidly high: you need to be very familiar with the deck. Multiple plays are required, as it's impossible to play without having a general idea of what you can draw. Also, because it is a deduction game, the game's mechanisms obscure what other players do. Which is great for veterans, but newbies can't properly analyse what others are doing, as they simply see the results. Thankfully, once all players are familiar with the game, it flows super fast. Also, once all players are familiar with it, games can be consistently finished in twenty minutes or less.  For many years I've given this game four stars. Now, it raises to five. Many others come and go, but not this one. It's a game I always find enjoyable, and even more engrossing the more I play it.

As a fan of San Juan, a former Magic player, and an occasional SF reader, I suppose that I am one of the main targets for this game. The simultaneous action selection makes a large difference with San Juan, although of course one still wants to benefit as much as possible from other players' actions. There is a fair number of strategies, or rather bits of strategies which have to be combined (depending of course on your card draws) in order to win the game. Replayability is very good, and scalability as well (the advanced variant for 2 players adding some more subtlety). Additionally, the artwork is great, which is certainly not needed to make a great game, but definitely doesn't hurt.",28143,,0.9709,positive,46,51,0

leungd,10,"Since we really liked [GAMEID=8217], [GAMEID=28143] seemed like it should have been a sure shot.  However, we held off on getting it for quite a while.  I was worried about the theme and the iconography not being appealing.  However, we finally got this in a trade and once we tried it out, we were hooked!  It's now one of our favorite games, and probably the second heaviest game that we have.  I shouldn't have worried.  This game was an amped up [GAMEID=8217]---it took the same basic gameplay, but added so much more.  It retained the feeling of building special cards, but in this case separated out Worlds and technology-oriented Developments.  However, added to these card combos were so many more paths to victory---you could go military, you could go exploring valuable worlds, you could set up a production/consumption engine.  All of this kept the game very fresh, although we're looking forward to trying the expansions.  The theme:  I was initially afraid that she wouldn't like the theme, although in retrospect I wouldn't have thought that Spanish colonialism would have been an attractive theme anyway.  She does put up with it, and she had a lot of fun with the art (especially cards like the Galactic Trendsetters or the Resort).  On the other hand, I really like the theme as I was a big fan of the Davin Brin Uplift novels.  Although abstracted, I do get the feeling of building a space empire.  I think that the more routes here compared to [GAMEID=8217] makes the game a little more real---e.g., there's a gameplay and thematic difference to military or production strategies.  The icons:  We had no problem with them.  By the second or third game, it wasn't even an issue anymore.  I was a little surprised by that, and thought that we would miss the text, but the icons producd a very clean result and lets you easily see what your opponent is building.  Interactivity:  Although it's been called multiplayer solitaire, we find the game has quite a bit of interactivity.  We're always looking at what each other is doing and we're constantly trying to guess and bluff what phase the other player will call that turn.  It's an additional layer of optimization that you have to do to play well.  Complexity:  I was worried about the complexity of the game, but it turned out to not be a problem.  She quickly grasped the rules and by the fourth or fifth game she was already scoring up to 54 points.  However, if we had not played [GAMEID=8217] before, it probably would have been [i]very[/i] difficult to pick up.  If you haven't played either, I would suggest picking [GAMEID=8217] up first.  On the other hand, the added complexity adds a lot to the game.  Having played [GAMEID=28143], I'm not sure if we'll ever go back...  So far, we've only played it with two, and mostly with the experienced two player rules.  It works very well.  This is another case where the two player game is different from the multiplayer game---you now call two phases each turn.  This gives you more control and ease in executing card combos, making the game more strategic.",28143,,0.9936,positive,46,51,0

jdludlow,10,"The moment my copy arrived, I sleeved all of the cards.  These are identical in size to Magic cards, so there are plenty of sleeve choices.  I went with the fairly expensive ""Japanese"" brand metallic sleeves for the main deck, and some heavy UltraPro for the role cards.  This doubled the cost of my set, but in the long run it's going to pay off.  I expect to play this game a lot.  I'm a huge fan of San Juan, and enjoy but rarely play PR.  I'm also a long-time lover of Magic.  Combining these becomes a no-brainer for me.  Race is a ton of fun.  The multiplayer solitaire complaints are nonsense.  Have those people play face up against experienced players and see if they still feel isolated and free to do whatever they want. ",28143,,0.9761,positive,46,51,0

joelee,10,"Excellent game and I can really see the similarities to Puerto Rico when I play it. However, the way the game plays with the simultaneous role selection and the ordered phases of the roles is fantastic. There is a learning curve to the game but come on most of the games on this site require you to learn the intricacies of the game.  Is the game multi-player solitaire? No more so than Puerto Rico to me. Much like Puerto Rico you can look over the table to see what you opponents have going for them in their tableau and also see the number of cards in their hand. Based on that you can make a hunch as to what role they are selecting. Do you want to develop/settle? Is there anyone else at the table holding a lot of cards? If so it likely that player is going to call one of those actions and if you have no preference as which then choose a different type of action that you'd also like to get done this round.   Can people help out their opponents? Sure they can. However, unlike Puerto Rico where they tend to help out the player to their left, in RftG they could help any other player at the table. For instance if someone isn't paying attention to cards in play someone could play out a development/settle action that would allow another player to get to his twelfth card and end the game.   Okay, so I've compared it to PR because of the similarities how about the differences. In PR I feel that there are a few standard opening moves and several buildings that are far superior buys than others. In RftG I have not seen a standard opening move. You have to initially deal with what you're opening hand is and then modify your agenda as you receive more cards. In PR coins are currency while in RftG the cards in your hand are the currency so you must decide what you're planning on playing onto the table vs use as currency. And since you can only get 12 cards to the table you have to decide how important each card is to your objective. There are times where a card that looks cool just doesn't really fit in with your plans so walk away.  A deep, rich, rewarding game with plenty of decisions to make that plays in  30 minutes and leaves you with the desire to play just one more hand...amazing.    ",28143,,0.9973,positive,46,51,0

The components aren't bad either: The cards are very sturdy, and the artwork is nice, and serious thought has been given to usability issues. Thanks to the graphic design, layout and the icon system, gameplay is really smooth and it is very easy to keep track of your special powers.  Lots of possibilies for ultimate killer combos, and for me the game feels more like a hand management game than a snowball engine optimization scheme. There is also quite the right amount of outguessing, which usually ends in me choosing the wrong phase anyway ;P  Success depends mostly on how good you are, but since the game only lasts about half an hour, and (unlike in most snowball engine games) gameplay and artwork don't suck astronomically at first sight, it is reasonably easy and fast to reach a comfortable skill level.

If you find yourself short of acquiring them, then Intrigue cards can help out. Neat element with Intrigue cards allows for a late attempt at another action to make up for action, in player order. Seems very well balanced overall. Only complaint is why the Quest cards come up randomly with the wide variation of victory points, instead of in stages. Need to grab these early when they appear and hang on to them until they can be paid for, even though it might seem like wasting a precious action. UPDATE: Bumped down one point after second play. Seems that building a building may not be a good strategy, as others will use it before yourself, even though you get a small payment for it. Have to play again to see how it balances.

familywontplay,10,"What a gem and what a surprise!  Don't let the name Dungeons & Dragons in huge letters plastered across the box fool you--this is NOT Dungeons & Dragons, not even close.  This is a resource game with quests.  Rules are simple and easily learned.  The game lasts 8 rounds, play is relaxed and fun.  Each player's unattained quests and resources are common knowledge so strategy is important when a player deals out attacks or rewards.  Switching positions on the score track is common, and game end can reveal an unexpected winner.  The game also has one of the really nice inserts.  It is a bit fiddly putting away, but there is a place for everything and when the box is closed & even transported, and the quality contents stay put.    All really liked this game.  Looking forward to some obvious expansions.  EDIT: I have played a lot of games now with a lot of people.  I haven't begun to tire of it, and everyone has liked it.  Increased the rating.  Increased the rating again.  How appreciative we all are for the simplicity of this game.  There is no question what to do on the board; All the quests and their rewards are clear; The building benefits are obvious; and the Intrigue cards are all unambiguous and easily understood.  The rules are easy to remember--don't play it for a year (unlikely) and pull it out and start playing.  How nice it that?",110327,,0.9954,positive,65,31,3

danamark,10,"Like it for the same reasons the hardcore Euro people don't, just Euro enough without the excessive, place these guys, get something, trade in, to build something else bigger, trade that in, for bigger, repeat and lacking the overload of options found in many Euros. OK they did a D&D theme so what? Had to have some theme, excellent game, theme works. And yes it is not a true D&D as you know it, I guess that theme was hijacked and it can't be used in another type of game without upsetting the Fanboys. It does need something other then cubes for people, 25 x 4 colored meeples or disc with character embroiled would have been the icing on the cake. Guess they wanted to keep down cost. Only minus, very, very slightly cutthroat, somewhat like Mission Red Planet, less than Ticket to Ride. Shouldn't stop you from buying it.  Purchased Danny's aka Relax wooden meeple replacements.  http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1379043/lords-of-waterdeep  After playing this game more have to say it is well worth buying, very enjoyable. My only complaint with it is where they places the four upright quest cards on the board. If they do a reprint I hope they move this to the center of the board. The player at the opposite end of the board can have a hard time seeing the four quest cards laid out, other than that a prefect game.",110327,,0.9705,positive,65,31,3

This is like a dream come true, I couldn't have asked for better. If you like Legacy games and dungeon crawls... please make yourself a gift and get this. You cannot not play this!  #1 BEST Dungeon crawl #1 BEST Legacy game #1 BEST Cooperative game  Also one of my SO's favorite games.  Update after 25 plays : I have now played 25 games of Gloomhaven on normal mode (23W-2L) in 3 weeks and I still can't wait to play some more. I haven't played a single other board game since I joined this amazing world. I prefer it with 2 or 3 players. With 4 it's a bit too long (I've played 1 game, but the scenario was pretty long also) but I'd need to try it again just to be sure.  Update after ending the main story: We have now returned to playing other games as there is less addiction to unlock stuff and since we ""finished"" the game. But boy this was the only thing we could get ourselves to play in 2-3 months. We played over 80 hours I'm pretty sure and we were playing mostly 2-player. This game has a lot to unravel. But for some reason when the campaign was finished we completely stopped. I must say the last two characters we unlocked and played were support characters and the combination in a 2-player game was less interesting.",174430,,0.9959,positive,69,25,3

bwt2q,10,"Gloomhaven is, at the time I wrote this, the #1 ranked game on BGG.  I think the consistently high ratings are well deserved.  I have really enjoyed the 7.5 games I've played so far (we're mid-mission right now!).  Gloomhaven is, first and foremost, a kind of optimization puzzle that you solve with 1-3 of your friends.  It has received much criticism because the puzzle is mostly the same, which I think misses the point.  This an excellent puzzle, with a large number of truly meaningful decisions, and scenarios that have very finely honed difficulty.  It's like a book of Crosswords or Sodoku - if you don't like the puzzle, a whole book will seem boring.  But if you like the puzzle, then it's great.  I find the puzzle of Gloomhaven to be absolutely enthralling, and the scenarios do a great job, IMO, of mixing it up enough that I don't feel like I'm just rinse and repeating my way through the game.  YMMV.  If you're thinking about buying it, you should know that you can play the first scenario for FREE with any of the first 6 classes on Tabletopia.  See if you like the puzzle before sinking $100 into it.  Aside from the main game, Gloomhaven's scenarios and campaign are really a labor of love, and it shows throughout.  There are way more enemies here than there really need to be, but it sure is nice to not fight the same 6 enemies all the time.  The standees work well, and keep the game affordable, so I appreciate them even if I still want minis.  Likewise for the character classes - 17 is more variety than most people will ever see, but it's there for those who want to explore.  I love that you are supposed to play the game to unlock the classes.  Each individual class has an individual set of higher level cards that become accessible as they level up, plus individualized perks that make their modifier deck better.  The modifier deck is brilliant, by the way, and the way you can improve it is simple yet fantastic - one of the many ""little"" touches that makes Gloomhaven such an amazing creation.  Lastly, I want to mention that I am currently playing Gloomhaven with my kids, who are 11, 9, and 7.  My youngest definitely needs a lot of help figuring out what she wants to do.  I give the 9yo some advice each turn about general group strategy and he plays competently, although not always optimally.  My 11yo plays with zero advice (he wouldn't listen anyway), and plays very well.  It's been a great experience.",174430,,0.9989,positive,69,25,3

ReinhartTR,10,"This game is a solid ten. It is the [i]only[/i] ten in my collection. It is [i]that[/i] good. The base of the game is it's tactical dungeon crawling mechanics and they are breathtaking. But what elevates this [i]masterpiece[/i] to the upper echelons of glory and immortality in the hobby is the legacy aspects. You aren't destroying things, you are [i]building[/i]. Improving the town, unlocking new (wildly varied) classes, slowly sussing out the secrets of the town, the world, opening envelopes, discovering secrets and watching it all unfold before you. Retiring characters gives you new experiences, both as classes and town/road events where you encounter your retired characters. It also gives you access to a book which further fleshes out the world. Some argue the game doesn't have enough story but there is enough there to enthrall me and help keep my interested in enjoying the marvelous system that Isaac Childres has created, and the world he has envisioned. Everyone I have put this in front of has said something similar, if you can find this for a reasonable price, buy it. Hell, even if the price is [i]slightly[/i] unreasonable, you should still buy it. It's worth every penny.  You can read my review [geekurl=/thread/1720130/welcome-gloomhaven-initial-impressions-now-50-less]here[/geekurl] if you're interested.

Terry Egan,10,"I played this four times at the 2008 Gathering of Friends and purchased it the same week (which says something, since I purchase games very selectively these days). I found Stone Age to be quite engaging. I tend to rank games that really grab me a bit low with the intention of bumping up the rating if the title stands up to the test of time. I think Stone Age may merit being bumped up to a ""9"" rating and a spot in the ranks of elite games in my collection ... if the large swings in luck inherent in all dice games don't someday sour my initial, very favorable reaction. Note: After many, many plays of Stone Age, it hasn't lost any of its luster. Rating bumped up to 9, making this one of the elite games in my collection. Update ... now one of fewer than 20 games out of 900 I've rated that scores a 10.

jvalj,10,"This game is a clear 10 for me in its online BSW format (and I don't make this statement lightly - check my ratings). In person I would give it a 9 or 8 because it is a bit too slow for frequent in person play. At half an hour the game is the best yet created (for my taste) - at 90 minutes it is also good but there are many games I would choose first. Since it is available online and I have learned so much from the game I am finally going to give it a 10 (it was only a 6 after my first four plays).  What I love about the game is that every decision is interesting and fast. The probability elements are perfectly implemented. It is clearly a game of skill - a few people have played hundreds of 3 player games with win rates of 80%, and yet average players can share a table with very good ones and have a chance at winning. Contrary to many comments I have read I am certain that it is a very deep game - I am still experimenting and learning new things. The game is fantastic for 2 or 3 players - 4 player has fewer interesting decisions and a lot more downtime but is still playable.",34635,,0.996,positive,65,35,0
Vaughn,10,first play - 4 players - This was a ton of fun. I loved all the choices you had each round. The dice rolling and cards that came up added a welcome dose of randomness to the game. I came in second becasue I put too much stock into the tools early on when I should have been concentrating on making more meeples and farms. I was one artifact short of the full set which still would have had me in second but only by a slim margin. I'm looking forward to my next play of this one. ,34635,,0.8555,positive,65,35,0

I like the fact that you can start out by just playing to your own advantage, but then can grow into (a bit) deeper strategies, such as preventing your opponents from getting items that will help them with their own chosen paths to victory points.  Still a pretty light game, though.  Awesome production and thought went into the actual physical components too!  Wooden bits, nice art, thick card stock, and a leather dice cup!  Those who love Settlers may really enjoy trying Stone Age too.  Fresh new mechanics and game play, yet maintains elements of luck and dice rolling.

Slyght,10,"My rating was made previous to all the ratings drama that started in December 2015, and is based on a full playthrough of the campaign.  Pandemic Legacy takes a favorite game of mine, and adds an excellent narrative-based campaign on top of it.  The campaign kept me hooked through all twelve months, in many ways like a good TV show does.  It managed to add interesting mechanical and plot twists to the game without bogging down the game in complexity.    Do I care that at the end of it all I'm left with a game with no replay value?  Not anymore than I care that at the end of a movie in theaters I'm left with a ticket stub or at the end of a meal at a restaurant I'm left with an empty plate.  It's one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had, and well worth the $50 I paid for it.    Since Rob said he does appreciate more feedback about the game, I will say that while the Legacy deck did provide excellent pacing to the game, I did miss all the packets from Risk Legacy with goals on them.",161936,,0.9812,positive,80,16,1

Cheesechick,10,"Disclaimer: I am a Pandemic nut. Pandemic is one of my all-time favorite games.  I think it's one got some of the cleverest design around, and I've played all of its expansions to death. Unquestionably Pandemic [i]as a system[/i] rates a perfect 10 for me.  Coming to Legacy, I was a bit worried that the surprises for veteran players would be minimal. That I'd enjoy the campaign play, find novelty in the Legacy aspect, but ultimately be employing the same strategies I had been for years now.   Good god, how wrong I was. Without spoiling anything, I can confidently say that this game will make you think differently. You will push the basic rules you've come to know in very different directions for very different purposes. Some of this is due to new mechanics which require different lines of thinking, but I also underestimated just how much the campaign play would impact the basic experience. There's a whole new fascinating decision space to navigate, and even something as (previously) simple as selecting characters takes on a whole new cognitive twist.   And what's more, the Legacy aspect only serves to make these dilemmas even more nail-biting. This game has real, true-blue dramatic and mechanical stakes.  I could gush about this game forever, but the point is whether you're a veteran or a newbie to the Pandemic franchise you owe it to yourself to play this game. Seriously, just get it.  Update: 01/10/16 - we won! Final score: 766. Thus ends the saga of Hank McChiselbeef Sr., AIDS McCancer, Dr. Doqtuer M.D., Col. Mustard, Lady Flibble, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and Jim ""Needles"" McGillicutty.  The fight against Avian Swine Flu, Sudden Poop Explosion Disease, Erectile Dysfunction, and Zambles is over.

farsidehobbes,10,"Wow, just 2 plays in (both losses) and we've had a great time.  The few subtle changes that they've made so far are great.  After playing through March we've added so many new things.  This campaign gets better and better.  It will be tough to go back to vanilla Pandemic at the end of it.  I may have to check out the regular expansions or borrow some ideas from PL to create my own house rules.  After May, this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had.  Hitting July-Sept, the new mechanisms and changes to the storyline have been great.  Just completed the game, having lost December twice.  Nice ending to the story arc.  Overall, this is a must-play game that everyone should experience.  Gave away at the Hoopla math trade",161936,,0.9849,positive,80,16,1

Caedmus,10,"WOW! Game of the year for sure. My wife and I have never had a gaming experience like this! It was edge-of-your-seat, cinematic, and full of surprises along the way. There were moments of triumph and defeat, frustration and excitement, and even times where it seemed like our fate would come down to simple luck.  We have played through the whole year. Went 11-4 playing 1 character each, and both of us absolutely loved it.   My wife, who is not really into games, not only helped power through 15 games in around 2 and a half weeks, but often suggested playing. We also had really great conversations around what had just happened or what we thought was going to happen, which doesn't happen often with games that hit our table.  This deserves it's 10. Not because it's a fad, not because I'm cult-of-the-new, not because it's the new hotness, but because it's an excellent game that kept me coming back. I wish my season wasn't over but I'm definitely on board for season 2!",161936,,0.9867,positive,80,16,1

Such an incredible mix of the original Pandemic mechanisms meshed into an ongoing campaign that really builds the tension and delivers an amazing narrative, filled with stress, tension and a roller-coaster of competing decisions.

tesuji,10,"Short, challenging game that requires strategy and cooperation to win. Some luck and chaos too. Theme is rich. Bits are first class. Very cheap price.  Tons of fun. Playing time is about 30 minutes. For me, it definitely has that ""Let's play again!"" aspect.  About as complex as Pandemic overall but a little shorter. Besides their different themes, a key difference between FI and Pandemic is the board: will be different each game, and it changes during play so you have to adapt and keep your vital routes open.  Gamers should set the initial Water's Level appropriate to their skill level. The lowest settings are more suitable for play with families and kids.  Solitaire is very do-able. (See my session reports for rules variant ideas.)  Forbidden Island is now on my shortlist of best gateway games. I used to think Pandemic was Matt Leacock's masterpiece.

pillsy,10,"Simple rules, fast-paced play, and beautiful artwork on the  ""board"" combine to make this a favorite of ours. Given how simple it is, there's a lot variation from one game to the next due to the different initial set-up of the island and the different player roles. We've found that it gets distinctly harder with fewer players, as the limited number of treasure cards you can hold in only two hands means you  frequently have to cycle through the deck repeatedly to get matching sets of four.",65244,,0.886,positive,74,22,2

cfarrell,10,"It's true, I definitely enjoy Pandemic much more for the added nuance (i.e., complexity). But Forbidden Island is great for playing with mixed groups or with kids. Games that work well for adults and kids playing together are actually extremely rare, and good ones are rarer still. True ""gateway"" games that can really engage both hobbyists and non-hobbyists in the same game are similarly scarce, but Forbidden Island manages it and you can reasonably expect to convert a few people to Pandemic Legacy.  For what it's trying to do and who it's aimed at, I actually think this is a better game than Pandemic. For gamers, just go right to the highest difficulty levels, which should engage even hardened coop veterans. The many good expansions do give Pandemic much higher replayability, but Forbidden Island will clearly have broader appeal.",65244,,0.9834,positive,74,22,2

Nick Barker,10,"Initially I had concerns about play balance but I no longer think that there is an issue there.  A highly entertaining game, with plenty of scope for skill and lots of replay value.  A few minor niggles to counterbalance my generally positive impression.   1. Few of the events are sufficiently valuable to play as events. So the mechanism means that you will use them for movement and hope that they later end up in your opponent's hand and that he will be forced to use them for movement and thus trigger an event in your favour. This is okay, but there are ways to prevent having to trigger an event for the other player. So events can either fail to happen or turn up at peculiar times. A Marshall Plan or the creation of the Warsaw Pact in the 1980s?   2. Some of the events, such as NATO, are utterly pointless.  3. The DEFCON track is too drastic. It spends the game hovering over the nuclear threshold which means that coups are too difficult to mount and that much of the map is usually invulnerable to coup or realignment attempts. In four games, we only did a single realignment option.  4. The typical GMT production which is generally okay but let down by slipshod minor details like incorrectly printed map, cards, play aids and instant errata on some rather important points.

The cold war history is interesting and the game presents you with a number of difficult choices.  Those seeking the breakout of a ""hot"" war need not apply.  The game even elegantly incorporates the fear of mutually assured destruction by limiting players aggressive actions with a DEFCON track.

crackedlcd81,10,"A tremendous piece of game design that by rights should go down in history as one of the seminal and significant games of our time.  There have been several excellent card-driven wargames precipitated by the now-classical Mark Herman designs (including real treasures like Wilderness War and Paths of Glory) but what really sets Twilight Struggle apart from its peers is its amazing ability to provide accessible, straightforward gameplay without sacrificing historical detail, richness, and narrative.  This is a game you can explain in 15 minutes to a complete newbie and within 2-3 hours you've burned through 45 years of tension, turmoil, and upheaval.  The game's systems are logical and remarkably stripped down yet never so abstract as to deny specificity.  The cardplay, as we've come to expect from the genre, provides not only a sense of playing through a timeline but also multiple decision points in each hand- what to play, how to play, when to play.  The theme is a knockout and the use of wargame mechanics to portray an abstracted war is nothing short of genius.  GMT's production is, as usual, functional and somewhat spartan but that being said the mapboard is probably their most attractive piece to date.  Folks, seriously, if you're interested in anything from hardcore wargames to middle-weight Euros, this is one to pick up and savor for many years to come.  The bar is set for wargames of this type fairly high by Twilight Struggle, and I can't wait to see if Mr. Gupta and Mr. Matthews are ready to push it up even higher in the future.

PUERTO RICO, CAYLUS oder AGRICOLA getan haben, die mit ihren Ideen nachfolgende SpielejahrgÃ¤nge nachhaltig geprÃ¤gt haben und es bis heute tun. Dabei brauchte TERRA MYSTICA einen langen Atem um bahnbrechend und weltweit die Brettspielwelt zu erobern. Die ersten Ideen zu TERRA MYSTICA entstanden Mitte der 90er als CATAN noch die Lande beherrschte, die TERRA MYSTICA nun seit 2012 umgrÃ¤bt. Dabei beschrÃ¤nkte sich TERRY MYSTICA nicht nur darauf einfach einen neuen Mechanismus zu kreieren, sondern gleich ein neuartiges Spielkonzept zu erfinden, das seinesgleichen vergeblich suchte: allein die konzeptionelle Leistung individualisierte VÃ¶lker mit speziellen, asymmetrischen FÃ¤higkeiten in immer neuen Konstellationen dennoch ausgeglichen aufeinanderprallen zu lassen, ist genauso groÃŸartig wie Frank Heerens Mut, in diese neue Spielidee in einen extra dafÃ¼r neu gegrÃ¼ndeten Verlag zu investieren. The Birth of TERRA MYSTICA und Feuerland ist ein verdientes Symbol dafÃ¼r, dass sich wahre unternehmerische Risikobereitschaft an KreativitÃ¤t orientiert, die sie verkaufen will und nicht am Profit, denn sie damit erzielen will.

Michiel,10,"Excellent intriguing game that blends together many familiar mechanisms and adds at least one new one (the way power works). Optimization game, interaction could have been more. Different races with different abilities keep the game varied. Each race requires a different development route. You need to plan for that at the start of the game to take maximum advantage of those special abilities. The bonus tile you choose each round can also be critical to your development. I like it better with each play, the game remains in my head. It is a challenging game, but for a spatial game interaction remains limited.  Update: played all 14 races. Now that I tried them all, the choice at the start to pick a race depending on bonustiles, roundtiles other colours and races in play etc. is great and challenging. I love this game more and more. It has lots of long term and short term planning. in some cases it is possible to largely plan your actions for the full game ahead to take maximum advantage of bonusses. And I love it when a plan comes together, some guy named Hannibal used to say in the 80's.  Further update: 22 plays and I still don't tire of it.

Phrim,10,"This is a building game in which you're trying to build the various buildings on your player board to increase your income, Hansa Teutonica style.  The higher-level buildings have increased costs and require you to replace lower-level buildings, which will send the lower-level buildings back to your board and thus increase your income in some ways, but decrease it in others.  The game encourages players to get in each other's way, as there are significant bonuses for being next to an opponent.  Turning this all into points is the tricky part, because while some of your points may come from having an impressive city during endgame scoring, most of your points will come from performing certain actions during certain turns, taking roles that may not be as beneficial income-wise, or using your special ability.  Oh yeah, and there are 14 distinct races each with their own special ability, that will really define how you play the game.  There's a lot going on here, and I love every bit of it.

Having 14 different ways to play ensures replayability. I can't think of another euro, that after 20+ games, I feel there is still more to explore.  Much more than the usual put a worker here-and-there to collect cubes to convert to veeps.  The play time is excellent at 25 minutes per player.  Update. Raised from 8.5 to 9.0.

OnlyHuman,10,"Excellent deeply strategic game.  I want to own this game, but with other deep, long playing time games I do own never finding their way to my table...it would be hard to justify this purchase...but I may anyway...I did!  14 different races, with their own special abilities, try to establish their colonies in this barren world.  You have to terraform the terrain tiles to a terrain that your race can live on.  As you build your town for every building you build you get an extra bonus income, sometimes a special ability.  When improving a building you need to remove the older building, so you lose that bonus, the way this feature is handled reminded me of Hansa Teutonica, a game I love.  You also are vying for gods' favors (cults) and managing your purple power discs.  The game is really deep and lasts a bit long, but it is great fun.  After my second play I am eager to keep playing.  This game is really fun, deep, and has just enough to scare away non-gamers marking this my top 'gamer's games'.",120677,,0.9951,positive,63,35,2

A very strong spatial component (with blocking as interaction) and strongly assymetric player positions from start to finish due to each player having different special powers and different terrain preferences.  I just love the asymmetric races. Played with 5, which felt just right, so can see how 6 might feel a bit cramped. First game felt like it went rather fast (under 2 hours with 5 newbies). I'd worry about the turn order mechanism, except that at least in this case the turn order didn't feel like it played a role all that often.  Note: this game has a lot of special powers and production bonuses that are clearly marked on the components, but that are also easy to forget.

I seldom rate a game after so few games, but I know this one will be at least a 9. I suspect it will join my '10' group, a very exclusive group of games, with a few more plays. Not easy to explain, but very intuitive to play. Lots of depth and replay-ability.   Three Plays: It's a 10! Only downside - our group plays slow - but, we enjoy a less hectic approach to gaming.  Six Plays: Still playing with the beginners set-up. Have 5 people trained to play it. Ready to move to the Random set-up. Love it.   Ten plays: using random set-ups. Still loving it and feel there is so much yet to discover. I have only played a few of the 14 races, so far (Nomads, Witches, Fakirs, Alchemists, Chaos Magicians, and Swarmlings.)   14 Plays: my favorite game of all time.

Maccit,10,"I gave Terra Mystica my one and only 10 ever in my 800+ collection. I really cannot find any flaw in it's design. Even the 45 minutes you need per player pass by very quickly. Yes it is a heavy game. It is a true brain burner with tons of choices to make every turn. It is a challenge to the mind. And sure, that must be your cup of tea. Yet it is the only heavy game I found myself wanting to play right again after 3+ hours of gaming. It has no luck factor whatsoever except for the starting set up and that is not decisive for the outcome of the game. Try before you buy but do yourself a huge pleasure and play it at least once. It is a true work of art. A classic with a very functional graphic design. I find myself explaining the game in less than half an hour and all players know ,thanks to extremely well designed player boards, exactly what they can and cannot do. I thank myself every day for having a clear moment and visit the Essen stand late on sunday so I could pick up one of the unpicked preorders. It is simply the best game I have ever played.

Thorwolf,10,"The gem of 2012 which has already become my favorite game- this one has 14 different factions to play, bonus tiles selected after passing, which give a unique advantage for the upcoming round and which increase in value ala Puerto Rico style for those not selected, passing first allows the player to go first in following round, building placement on board reveals increasing incomes as popularized in Eclipse, just the right amount of player interaction in competing on the cult tracks for majority bonuses, mini-actions similar to a rondel without the rondel to keep play flowing at a good pace, and some territorial placement urgency to establish cities on the board. Interesting mechanism to generate ""power"", a waxing/waning, recycling currency pool which provides flexibility in acquiring the other resources- priests, workers, and money. A bit daunting to learn/teach, but the effort is well worth the time investment. Once through the rules, the play is elegant and intuitive such that review of the rules is rarely necessary. To sum up, those who prefer thematic/Ameritrash designs may want to try before they buy. Eurogame fans can confidently place their preorders- this title packs more strategic depth in a fast-moving, relatively short play time than any has in a long time. Nearly endless variety, not only with the faction choices but also with the varying bonus tiles and the varying round bonus tiles and their varying sequence.",120677,,0.9926,positive,63,35,2

theaaron,10,"Excellent. The game is just fun to play, and the different player powers make it a different experience every time.  I also want to commend the iconography and built-in reminders. There's a lot going on in this game, but I haven't had to reference the rulebook at all after the first play. Everything just makes sense and is easy to remember because of the graphic reminders on the player boards and the main board. What do I get during the income phase? Just look for the hand icon. How much do I pay to build this? Just look at your player board. How many points for end-game scoring? Just look at the main board. What are my options on a turn? Look at your reference card. Great design, great layout, great game.  Update: I've now had this game since around the time it came out and I've played it several times with different groups. It's still a definite 10. This is the perfect ""heavy"" game for me. Some games (such as those by Vital Lacerda or What's Your Game) are complicated just for the sake of being complicated. Terra Mystica is heavy in the sense that there is no randomness (outside of the initial setup) and there are several different elements in play at all times. The difference, though, is that in TM everything flows smoothly and just makes sense. There are none of those ""fiddly"" rules that I hate and overall the game is pretty easy to explain.

Surya,10,"tl;dr: masterpiece  This game took off like a rocket when it came out. And people are still playing it way more than most games from 2012. And that was an EXCELLENT year with other masterpieces like [thing=119432][/thing], [thing=122515][/thing] and [thing=126163][/thing]! Man, what a year!!! There is a good reason why people are still playing this as much as they are despite the lack of new expansions: the game is very replayable out of the box and is a fucking good game! The different races and the way all the different game elements interact gives you an immense amount of game to explore, and each time is very enjoyable. And once you know the game, it's very doable to finish this in under two hours, which, for a game this deep, is very nice. Yeah, this is a masterpiece, I'm so glad I get to play it every time I do.  Rating: 10/10 BGG scale: 10/10  =====  This game got quite some buzz going at Spiel as it sold out quickly. I didn't get a copy, but a good friend did. There's quite a bit of wood and cardboard in the box, which justifies the higher price point, I guess. Everything is of excellent German quality, all though I would have really preferred them to use more thematic shapes for the different building types. And custom ones - we get some standard meeples, standard Catan houses and churches and standard cubes. But that's a minor complaint. I guess we've been spoiled in that department in the last couple of years :) The rule explanation wasn't short, but the game play is quite straightforward and downtime isn't too bad of an issue - at least not in my group, even when playing with 5. I really liked how this game seems to offer different strategies, and I look forward to playing this again soon. I wouldn't mind owning a copy.  Initial rating: 7.5",120677,,0.995,positive,63,35,2
chally,10,"[floatleft][ImageID=1450866][/floatleft][size=11][b][thing=120677]Terra Mystica[/thing][/size][/b] surprised me with its accessibility and speed of play.  A middle-weight game bordering on elegant is the last thing I would have expected from a collaberation between designers of [thing=13884][/thing] and [thing=20101][/thing].  Yet [thing=120677][/thing] most evokes memories of austere predecessors, such as [thing=43015][/thing] and [thing=107529][/thing].  That is not to say that [thing=120677][/thing] is uncomplicated -- it layers numerous ideas (indeed, one might argue a few too many) that require some time to wade through.  But the game progresses in a wave of quick turns featuring discrete and clearly defined options in pursuit of a handful of simple and well-understood goals.    [floatright][ImageID=1458783][/floatright]In all honesty, [thing=120677][/thing] is mechanically most reminiscent of 2011's [thing=72125][/thing], though I hesitate to introduce the comparison because I feel that it may mislead more than it illuminates.  The game begins by adopting defined races with unique special abilities, it progresses through players' management of multiple currencies tied to a [thing=25613][/thing] style tech tree for further specialization, all in the pursuit of developing and then competing on a shared central board.   Unlike [thing=72125][/thing], however, that seemed to build toward the culmination of just one or two strategies, [thing=120677][/thing] provides myriad opportunities to score points through a diffuse network of interrelated actions.  [floatleft][imageid=1450487][/floatleft]This seems to result simultaneously the blank canvas of a Jack-friendly sandbox game and the general dread that everything is necessary and nothing is quite sufficient.  Players can and will develop different skills, pursue different scoring opportunities, and yet continue to compete for (and complain about) the same fundamental building blocks.  It works in a way that I would not have expected upon just reading the rules.  I will be very curious to see how the game holds up over repeated plays.  Most importantly to me, I am interested in seeing whether increased player skill results in a more efficient pursuit of strategic paths, and, if so, what tax those efficiencies might levy on player interaction (which was quite high in our first game).   If sufficient quantities of the game are available, I am confident that [thing=120677][/thing] will end up being one of the defining titles of this year's Spiel fair.

qwertymartin,10,"I don't generally like co-operative games because they tend to feel like team solitaire and have the problem of one player taking over. But Hanabi is a marvel. It avoids the alpha player problem by strictly limiting the amount of information players can exchange; indeed that's the whole point of the game. Each player holds their hand of cards backwards, so that everyone except them can see them, and the team attempts to play all five suits out on to the table in ascending order. It's deliciously counterintuitive (at first players keep ruining the game by accidentally looking at their cards!) and admits some advanced tactics once players start trusting each other.",98778,,0.8986,positive,64,31,0

chearns,10,"This controlled information sharing, and the lack of knowledge in regards to your own cards, results in possibly the most cooperative game I've ever played. Not only can you not tell others what to do, but you have to rely on the information others give you in order to play your cards.  This game involves a lot of learning about your play partners. Some people tell you you have a red card so that you'll play it, some people tell you so that you'll dump it. Some people throw away the first card to the left, some the first card to the right. We don't talk about our reasons for communication and we discover them during play, although I suppose the game could be made easier by discussing strategies before play starts.  You have to trust your play partners. They told you about a particular card and not about another? You have to trust that they gave you the most important information first.  You also have to learn how to use the red tokens. There are three and you get the same score with zero, one, or two of them used, so having zero of them used, might indicate something you threw away that you should have tried to play.  You have to learn how to use the blue tokens. There are only so many of them and getting down to one often puts you in a nasty pattern of discarding good cards because you can't keep each other informed. You have to maximize the information you give the other players so that by combining the informations they get, they can learn about their hand with as few tokens used as possible.  You have to keep track of the discards to know what's safe to lose, and to figure out what you have in your hand.  You have to learn to prioritize what you need to tell your partners. Ideally they'll know their entire hand, but since that's impossible, what do they need to know first, and what can you afford to never tell them about?  The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. My best game to date? 24. And even if we ever get the game of 25, the perfect game, there's still the advanced game after that. This game has plenty of replayability.  Having played the game online, I can testify to two things, one, playing the game without having the remember anything and without having to worry about what others remember, is a lot more fun because you can then make very clever clue gives. Two, it is so much more fun to play the game with people you know.  Best ever : 25",98778,,0.9985,positive,64,31,0

PBrennan,10,"100+ plays. Now I've played this new edition, it all the same so it gets the same comment as the original. It's a tense co-op using just a pack of cards. As a team you're trying to build 1 pile of each colour from 1 up to 5 Solitaire style. There are extras of each number, except the 5s, so there's some give but not much. The tension comes because you can't see your own cards before you play them. You're reliant on other players spending turns informing you about details of your hand (ie these are 1's, or this is green). But you only get so many shots at this before people either have to play correctly to a pile (make 3 mistakes and it's game over) or discard a potentially needed card in order to replenish the supply of chips which allow the team to do a helper turn. The game elevates to you trying to provide / glean the maximum mount of information with the fewest possible hints. Which then builds the tension - when he said this was a 2, did he imply it was a playable 2 or a discardable 2. Given what else I see around the table, and what's on the 5 piles, I'm going to say it's ... playable. Arghhh!!! So you somehow need to build a series of conventions where the same hint means different things in different situations. The game is fun in a quiet, slow, stricken way and is aimed purely at fans of deduction games. I't gets replay if you enjoy the challenge of defining and then refining a set of protocols that consistently enable you a chance at a perfect score. The real downside is that thereâ€™s no room for the game chit-chat or shared emotion that are the usual drivers of co-operative games (this may be what makes it more appealing to non co-op lovers), as anything you do can be construed as providing clues above and beyond what youâ€™re allowed to provide. It can be wrenching watching someone draw the wrong conclusion from hints given so far and reach for the wrong card; to keep a straight face and not groan out loud, or make a face, or cough or simply yell out ""nooooooooooo"". Regardless, or maybe because of, I'm looking forward to the evolving discovery process and seeing how nailable this is with more play with the same group of players.",98778,,0.9794,positive,64,31,0
munihack75,10,"My most played game. I started with the first edition, imported from Canada, but picked up a deluxe European edition later (the definitive way to play, in my opinion). I also keep a pack of cards in the glove box for emergencies.  A wonderful game, one that I was intrigued with from the first play. Plays great with 3, 4, or 5. It's not even bad with 2 or 6. My go-to finisher. My group has scored a perfect game a handful of times at almost every play-count. We have several systems of understood communication, of course, that have developed mostly on their own, although we've had many discussions of our play after the game, explaining why we did what we did or what may have been expected. We try not to boss new players around, but let them learn the strategies at their own speed.    This game is great with a seasoned group, but it also has worked well with my family, including some of the youngest players, 6 or 7 years old that can even pick up some of the simple logic. It's an ingenious design, perfect in its elegance.",98778,,0.9948,positive,64,31,0

smilingra,10,"Brilliant little co-op that is a cross between Code 777 and Indian poker, in that you can see everyone else's cards but your own and are working as a team in order to get the cards down in order.  UPDATE: A group favorite (and one of mine). I'd love to get a copy of the deluxe edition with the tiles - they're very much worth it. I think what I like best is that everyone has to really do their own thing, so you really are working together as a team, and the weakest link really does pull you down. Also, the quest for a perfect score remains elusive, but it's nice to have a concrete number of how well you did to track your plays and see if you can't get more tiles the next time you play. The short playtime also is a nice bonus - it makes it a fun and worthwhile filler.",98778,,0.9951,positive,64,31,0

Mattias Persson,10,"Played 15-20 times since 2011. If you are looking for a quick, simple, interesting two-player game, you canÂ´t go wrong with Jaipur. One of my very few 10s. Each round takes about 15 minutes, so 30 or 45 minutes in total. The amount of luck is just right for a game like this, I think, though IÂ´m sure the variable points on bonus tokens can bother some players. My one quibble is with the set-up,  with the piles of tokens spread out. ItÂ´s not very elegant and itÂ´s cumbersome to re-set between rounds.",54043,,0.798,positive,70,29,0

The core mechanic of trading cards with the market and swapping them in sets for chips is nice enough, but the addition of the camels makes this game shine. The camels introduce a timing element - when do I sell? When do I take the camels? How is my opponent's hand; if it's full I will do something markedly different than if it's empty.  Overall, the perfect blend of luck and strategy.",54043,,0.9882,positive,70,29,0

For the sake of variety, a book of scenerios is consulted at that point to find out how the game will proceed.

I play this game every chance I get, because no matter how many times I play it, there is always something new in it. Who is the traitor, what does he want and how do we prevent it. Even after playing it for months, I have been surprised at the ingeniuety of the scenarios, and how different they all are, so every game really is something new. And if you should happen to get a haunt you've tried before, chances are that you have forgotten most of it since the last time because there are so many. My thumbs up to this game (so far the only one i've rated 10), and I hope there are going to many expansions in the future. The one cloud in the silver lining is that you need to download the FAQ's to play it properly, but that is a minor detail.",10547,,-0.2679,negative,60,34,3

Haven't played with fewer players to avoid wasting good scenarios. The larger the crowd, the better the experience? - You should download revised scenario booklets (in color here on BGG, by UniversalHead). Also, you should have some kind of chart in order to find appropriate tokens fast. - The players must be able to make up rules for unexpected situations every now and them.  Updated 9->10 in 2011 after 25 plays. I've come to accept this game as it is, even with its major flaws.

It's light enough to play fast but there inevitably comes a few agonising decisions over how long to hold out for better cards (vs giving useful cards to your opponent via the discard pile vs playing too early to a colour and limiting your score in it). The other hard decision each hand is whether to play safe or risky (by playing multiplier cards on a suit that you may score negative in if you don't get the high cards). There's no direct pussage and limited interaction, but your plays generate enough interest and tension (from time pressure to maximise your score before the deck runs out) to warrant a lot of replay.",50,,0.9217,positive,54,44,1

dougadamsau,10,"Players represent Italian families during the Renaissance, wielding power and influence.  There are 15 cards in the game, 3 each of the Duke, Captain, Contessa, Assassin and Ambassador.  These five types of cards each grant a special power in the game.  Two of these cards are dealt to each player, face down, and are ideally kept hidden throughout the game.  On a turn, a player chooses an action from a choice of eight, the five special powers above or three common powers.  The trick here is you can bluff - you may be holding the Duke, allowing you to take 3 coins, or you may not - but you can still claim you are taking the Duke's action and take 3 coins.  Any player can challenge your action, and if you're not holding the card allowing that action, you flip the card up - otherwise you reveal and replace it, and the challenger flips one of their cards face up.  If you have both cards flipped up, you're out of the round.  Last one standing wins.    This is a fun game of bluff and deduction, very similar in pace, size and fun as the recent Love Letter.  Players have to carefully monitor the cash flowing around the table, as a player who reaches 7 coins can call a Coup - an unblockable attack that forces a player to reveal a card.  Games only take 10 minutes, and are a lot of fun.  A little gem.  After a year and hundreds of games, of course it's a 10.  Perfection.",131357,,0.9887,positive,81,15,2

On a personal note, I almost didn't buy this because my wife does NOT like confrontational games.  That this game is entirely based on wiping out your opponent did not bode well.  However, she was able to pick it up quickly after we played a starter 30 point game.  She was annoyed and a bit antagonistic at first--especially after an initial loss.  However, she quickly realized she had been too non-confrontational and attacked heavily, in the second 50 point game, and won!   This game is about as smooth a game as I have run into.  The card design is intuitive and tactical plans are very easy to formulate.   The factions make strategic planning a breeze.  As an added bonus, the card art is deeply impressive.  I had only wanted a 2 player game.  I'm considering another pack now.    Looking forward to expansions.  Wow!     ",147020,,0.9824,positive,67,28,2

Blindsun,10,"""Update"" Bump to a 10.  Such a great ""comfort"" game.  I never don't want to play.  Play quickly and smoothly.  So easy to teach.  I love how the theme (space warfare) jives with the mechanics (Fleets taking turns launching offensives versus each other's home worlds).  The only way I could think it could be ""improved"" thematically would be for ships to have some defensive capabilities, although I imagine this would hurt the games playability, which is near perfect, in my eyes, at this point.   ""Initial"" Good: Easy to teach, theme integrates well with game flow, a plain fun experience, short play time, very good price.  Slight concern: might be too easy to over play the game. Might not be enough difference between various cards to keep the game fresh for long.",147020,,0.9807,positive,67,28,2

dm5k,10,"Maybe it's because this is my first deck builder but I love this game. The fact that this game is very easy to learn and 1v1 games can take around 20 minutes or even less makes this game quick and enjoyable IMO. Not to mention that it includes rules to play several different game types that support up to 6 players (You need at least 2 boxes of the base game to play with more than 2 people). The only downsides are that this game is lacking in depth and also they give you cards with numbers to keep track of your authority (which is basically your life). I just use a pen and paper. I highly recommend this game if you like deck builders, sci-fi, or quick learning group games.  Multiplayer game types:  Free For All - 3+ players - Pretty obvious how this works.  Hunter - 3+ players - You can only attack players authority to the left of you. You can also attack player bases to the left OR right of you.   Hydra - Teams of 2v2 or 3v3 with a combined authority. A team all goes at the same time and can combine their trade pool to buy things and combine their combat pools to attack bases or authority. Outposts protect the entire team from damage and must be destroyed first.  Emperor - 3v3 team game where everyone has their individual authorities. Each team has an emperor in the middle and two admirals (one on either side of him). The emperor can attack any enemy while the admirals can only attack the enemy admiral across from them. If an admiral defeats the enemy admiral across from him he may now target the emperor. When an emperor is defeated their team loses the game.  Raid - 3-6 players (1 boss and 2-5 raiders). 1 player is the boss and the rest are raiders. Basically the boss has higher authority and a larger hand size to make up for the lopsided teams. Raiders can discuss strategies but have separate authorities and do not share their trade or combat pools.  Coop Challenges - 1-6 players - There are currently only 2 challenges which are found in the Gambit Set. Up to 6 players can work to defeat either the Nemesis Beast Or Pirates of The Dark Star. Both of these challenges look hard.  ",147020,,-0.1909,negative,67,28,2
ShaunGamer,10,"Basically a space combat version of ascension. Lots of fun! Probably the best ""value for money"" deckbuilder on the market. Good variety in the core game with plenty of options for different tactics.  A great game to play solitaire but sticking with the two official solo challenges is limiting and requires an expansion,  However, there are fan created challenges and more solo stuff is on the way with Star Realms Frontiers. One of my most played games. :thumbsup:",147020,,0.9592,positive,67,28,2

Excellent art with a fun theme, simple but meaningful decisions, easy to teach, and quick to play.  This is a great game to have on hand with any group, especially casual gamers who love card games and want to try something a little different.  The card drafting provides good interaction, not so much verbally, but in paying very close attention to what other players are doing.  There is also zero individual down time, which is great.  Finally, if you want to get casual gamers into a deeper drafting game, such as 7 Wonders, this is an excellent way to get them fluent with the drafting mechanism making other games much easier to teach.

We were so impressed, that my friend went home and pre-ordered it that same day... even though it wouldn't come out for another couple months!  It was just delivered to him a few days ago, and we've already played it several times!  Such a quick, easy, fun game.

It's easy to pick up by non-boardgamers but also develops several layers of depth as you play it more.

In Blood Rage players develop their powers - which is cool - but for me it takes from the immersion. Goes into the pantheon of remarkable area control games.

gijoe250,10,"1st gameplay of it and everyone loved it! I got destroyed xo, wasn't to sure about my strategy and lost alot of battles xo. It was a blast though!  I'm back with tons more plays. It's a staple for the group. Something that shut up and sit down (favorite review group) pointed out is it seems more focused on the cards than anything else. And I'm okay with that! Makes it easier to pick up and learn.   I haven't played with the expansion yet, but seems like a good addition.  Some tips: Don't pass to many loki cards! If someone goes loki they will win! Grab one or two, you'll most likely get a chance to use them.   Also do not be afraid to change tactics after an age. Sometimes your cards will point you to a better strat.  Time passed: This is still a good game, but its starting to feel limited. Like I wish there was a bit more intelligent plays. I mean their is, but alot of it is heavily placed on the drafting. I guess I want a bit more from combat?",170216,,0.9888,positive,79,16,3

manowarplayer,10,"Looooooooooong. Played with 7 players... lots of down time and got mind-numbingly dull. However, I will play again - with a smaller group and see if this one cant get redeemed. Can so many BGG'ers be wrong??  UPDATE: 04-25-09  Played it with the CVW again last night after a long hiatus. I was pretty solid on the rules, but there is still a lot going on here and the initial explanation of everything takes a bit of time. Like before, I could tell that people were anxious to play, so I kept the explanations as short as possible and taught the game as we played out the first turn.  It took a few turns to get the flow going right, but once we did, everyone enjoyed the game. I think the sweet spot is 4-5 players as more tends to bog the game down - unless EVERYONE is comfortable with how to play.  We still made mistakes in some rules - but we corrected as we played and pushed on. We lost the game to the GOO that ends the game immediately if it ever awakens - we weren't paying attention and sealing enough gates - otherwise we might have had a chance.  Upgraded to a solid 8.5 and with plenty of interest to play again in the group.  UPDATE: 30-OCT-2010  Upgraded to a solid 9. We are now able to sit-down and PLAY the game without constant rule look-ups which increases the fun and decreases the playing time. The mechanics are now 2nd nature and we can focus on the strategy and game play instead of ""what happens next?"".  UPDATE: 12-10-2013  We got to play this two weekends in a row a few weeks ago (lost both games!) and it was a complete hoot! Arkham Horror has only steadily climbed up my ratings chart. It's tremendously fiddly with all kinds of exceptions and things that you have to try and remember, but once you have the basic flow down this all becomes much easier and you can simply focus on what needs to be done. Add in an expansion and watch the game take on a whole new feeling - Innsmouth is probably my favorite for this effect.  ...[b] Abstract [/b]...__________[]...[b]Themed [/b]..... .........[b] Luck [/b]...______[]____...[b] Skill [/b]........... ......[b] Simple [/b]...________[]__...[b] Complex [/b]... ..[b] Strategic [/b]..._______[]___...[b] Tactical [/b].... ....[b] Friendly [/b]...__[]________...[b] Cutthroat [/b].. .......[b] Fiddly [/b]..._[]_________...[b] Elegant [/b].....

crackedlcd81,10,"I'm eating crow on this one, I initially thought this was an good game buyoed primarily by the Lovecraft theme but after 10 plays I think this game is tremendous in terms of an old fashioned, 1980s style adventure game.  Arkham Horror is clearly the best of that field chiefly due to the ridiculous number of interactions, possibilities, and variety the game offers.  Unlike any other board game, Arkham Horror creates a real world for the players to move about in and some great opportunities for collusion and cooperation that aren't immediately evident, largely due to a somewhat protacted learning curve.  After a few plays a level of familiarity sets in and the game moves from ""good"" to ""great"".  Two things should be noted however, one is that games with more than 6 players can be a disaster of downtime and completely unchallenging, therefore uninteresting.  Also, the high degree of variability means that some games are inherently more thrilling than others, but when it all clicks (which is really about 80% of the time) it's magical.  Black magical.  I still think the ""fight the monster"" endgame is bizarre and not really very Lovecraftian, but at least the redesign team saw fit to include Azathoth, whose attack is ""Destroys the world"".  Great dark humour, hopelessness, and insanity round out another terrific FFG production that puts just about everyone else to shame in terms of graphic collateral and design.  Top tier, all the way- the best adventure board game ever published.",15987,,0.9168,positive,52,41,6

There is enough of the old game here that I was pleased that I don't have to go back and spend the bucks on it, but there is so much more in quality, quantity and elegance.  The only thing I liked a little better in the original game was that the monsters did more roaming, here they are a bit more static.  Still, I'm going to be playing this for years to come.    Sure, it is a little heavy on dice and luck, but the level of fun is pretty friggin high.  Be prepared for a long game though, certainly by todays standards.  If you play this with 5 or less then the downtime should be significantly decreased.  I really wouldn't recommend playing it with more than 5.    There is only one thing that I would change, when you get random cards to start with, you should be dealt one extra and discard one to tailor your character more toward your desires.    When I am in the mood for a horror game, I think that for me this is the be all and end all (and I've played a number of them).

jdkimble,10,"Ah, The Resistance. My favorite game.  We've had some amazingly good times. We've had some dramatically bad times. There have been ups and there have been plenty of downs. We've had people storm out of the room, cursing, declaring they would never play the game again. We've had people sit and look at their phone the entire game. I've had some of my favorite gaming memories, staring into my friends' eyes, trying to read there every movement and breath. This game has created friendships, torn them apart, and rebuilt them. Resistance is more than a game to us. Resistance is the foundation that has brought us together.  But, alas, no matter how many times we say that we're completely DONE with Resistance, we always come back for more. We just can't stay away. I would like to say a very warm thank you to Resistance for providing numerous hours of enjoyment to my gaming group.

touchstonethefool,10,"While at first I felt a bit let down by the fact that, despite a larger element of logical deduction, there was still a high level of uncertainty (a la Werewolf), The Resistance has really grown on me.   The logic element provides something to latch on to (even more so with the Plot cards), and really makes the choices interesting for the Spies. It seems to play better with fewer players (less downtime), and still manages to be tense throughout (unless you have some sucky spies).",41114,,0.0772,positive,53,42,1

RDewsbery,10,"Love - absolutely love - this game.  Whether you have five players or ten, it's hard to think of a better ""discussion"" game.  Werewolf is good, but has two obvious drawbacks - the need for a moderator, and the player elimination (it truly sucks to be killed in the very first night of a long game).  Resistance avoids both problems *and* adds in the voting mechanism so that players are presented with useable information about who might be what.  Balance-wise, playing without the plot cards gives a bias to the spies.  I've played over 20 times without the plot cards and the resistance has won only once or twice.  With the plot cards, the balance swings in favour of the resistance.  But you know what?  Balance issues really don't matter.  This game is all about staring at the person opposite you and convincing them that you are loyal, before turning to your left-hand neighbour and telling them that they are a no-good traitor who couldn't lie straight in bed.  I can't think of a better way to spend 30 minutes with a group of 5-10 friends.  [edit - 4 months later] Did I really rate this game a ten?  I was wrong - it clearly deserves an eleven.  Yes, I know the rating scale you use only goes up to ten, but mine goes to eleven.  Which is higher, obviously.  The only time I'd ever turn down a game of this is if it's past 2am and I've already played four games of The Resistance since midnight. ",41114,,0.9834,positive,53,42,1

walkie,10,"This game is so awesome.  You're given enough information to perform some quite complex deductive reasoning, but not enough to completely solve the problem.  I'm a logic guy and tend to argue vociferously for that angle, but so far the intuition and people-reading folks have been just as (if not more) accurate.  So there's still plenty of room for that.  Our group loved Werewolf, but I can't see us ever going back.  This game is Werewolf perfected.  The Resistance is more condensed and constrained than Werewolf, but our games actually end up taking longer because of all the protracted arguing, counter-arguing, and whatnot.  That's the fun part, of course.  Both being a spy and a resistance member are a ton of fun.  It's fun to puzzle through the information as a resistance member, and of course fun to deceive as a spy.  We've given the optional plot cards a few whirls, but they didn't take.  Straight up, this game is a pitch-perfect blend of deduction, people reading, and vein-popping arguments.

jojobinks,10,"BSG after being boiled down to its essence.  Was fun the one time I played it and was totally thrown by a tricksy spy.    from a geeklist after game night 6/12/2011:  i checked my collection just now to make sure i had resistance at 10.  then i considered downgrading another of my tens to show props to the big R, but did not (b/c i only have two other 10s).    i understand why there's been some backlash in our group against it recently, but here's why i think this game is probably most mostest favorite of all right now:  * [b]it's always different, and always in fucked up challenging new ways.[/b]  i feel like every game i have to ask someone to read me back his logic on a particular call 2x b/c i'm sure there's a point there, it's unfamiliar to me, and i want to get it.  then i have to figure out if i'm just missing the point or if tom is F'ing with me b/c he's a desperate spy or if he's trying to signal me as a chill morpheus or if he's just being sleepy-drunk.    *  [b]it's the game we play that's most about interacting with each other.[/b]  Can there be any doubt?  we joke and talk quite a bit during our JASE games too, but this game is about the social, and i think any game group could use more of that.  and that's what will always make this game refreshing in a 12 hour gamenight.  *  [b]the game is great at giving you a bunch of info, very little of it clean.[/b]  and the info you have that IS clean is usually clean only for you and not for anyone else.  i think the power has clearly swung blue for us as we've gotten better, but i think that's due for a shift b/c of this information gap.  i personally will be going to a 5 day seminar this week in order to improve my skills as spy.   okay, i was just thinking on last night's games and wanted to toss some praise where it's due.  there are downsides, including a) some player's uncomfortable experiences with playing roles, b) it feels really unfriendly when we bring in new players or inexperienced gamers (joe's boss and husband, ed, eli's lady friend) b/c they don't know what's going on and they eventually just want it all to end, c) the feeling that a 7+ player game is being dominated by only a few.    that said, F that, this game is the shit!  which is why 4 weeks from last night the game night at my house will consist of 12 hours of resistance mwahahhahahhaah (not intended as a factual statement).

Yes, their is a fair amount of luck with dice rolls and card flips, but as with many games, its all about luck management.  I really feel like I'm on the island struggling to survive.  Plays great solo.  Only reason it is not a 10 is because the rulebook is horrible--a perfect example of how NOT to write a rulebook.  You can't find anything quickly, no index, poor headings, and constant ""important"" headings which are meaningless and don't help you find the important info you are looking for.

Fit the landscape domino pieces you bid for into a 5x5 (or 7x7 grid for - recommended - two player  expanded game), bidding for the tiles.  It is the play area restriction that makes the game interesting and challenging.  You have to match at least one terrain to an adjacent tile or home tile.  So best leave a side of the home tile empty for our final tile to obtain optional all tile and centre bonuses.  Update Nov-11:  wonderful game.  Will become life long favourite.

Martin Ralya,10,"Oh, this is good. Light, but also unforgiving. The mechanic of sorting tiles less-likely to have crowns on them to the front of the line is brilliant, encouraging interesting decisions about turn order vs. tile choice.  In my first game, I enjoyed deciding where to place tiles -- and I frequently shot Future Martin in the foot with my placements. I blocked my daughter once, but couldn't play that tile myself; that's an interesting choice.  There's a neat rhythm to this game, and it's invitingly simple. I like it. I'm also impressed that it takes the core of a game I don't enjoy in the least bit, Dominoes, and makes a good game around it. Having tried it with two, I can't wait to see how it does with 3+.  Lovely components, to boot. Thick, thick tiles, king meeples, and a neat little castles -- all in a good insert.  ---  It took me until play 5 to realize that prioritizing matches above all is a great approach. By play 7 I'd clocked my best score ever, 50, and only missed filling two spots.  The economy of this design is brilliant. Every decision matters, and everything is so tight that every play counts. I've still got things to discover about how to play it well, too; it's got more depth than its light weight might suggest.  ---  10 plays in, re-rated from an 8 to a 9. I suggest this one all the time, I'm still terrible at it, but I love slowly getting better (and losing is fun, too).  ---  Sooooo for 12 enjoyable plays I have managed to 100% miss that you don't have to match EVERY side of the domino, just one. This game is now so much easier! Now I know why I've had so much trouble making quality kingdoms .  .  .  I wasn't sure whether I'd like it as much when played correctly, but I still love it. Now it feels like the gameplay matches its weight. And the funniest part is that all the games I played in Unintentional Hardcore Mode have made me surprisingly good at the actual game!  ---  After 16 plays, re-rated from a 9 to a 10. Kingdomino does everything I want it to do, and there's nothing more I can ask of it than to be the game that it is. It's brilliant.",204583,,0.9988,positive,76,22,0

Maximuss,10,"Mysterium is a murder mystery game with a creative twist.  It's a co-operative game in which one player takes on the role of a ghost, and the other players are psychics trying to help the ghost solve his murder of about 100 years before.  This is done through the distribution of Dixit-like cards by the ghost player to the psychic players.  The cards represent ""visions"" that the psychics have.  They then interpret these visions, and use the clues within them to narrow down suspects, locations, and weapons a la Clue.  This is the only means of communication the ghost has with the psychics.  The psychics, on the other hand, can speak with each other to give each other aid.  They'll need it too, because there's only 7 turns for the proper suspects, locations, and weapons to get picked.  From them the actual murderer must be discovered.  If this doesn't happen the group loses and the ghost continues to be tied to this plane of reality.  Mysterium is a fantastic game!  The artwork is top notch, the theme is intriguing, and the gameplay is really fun.  I had high hopes for this one, and it met them all.  Couldn't recommend this more highly.

With this edition, I think the game is not only fine, it's really awesome. In fact it's one of the few games so far that encouraged me to invest in the expansion because of how good it is.  My issues with the game are three, so far: 1. Pre-modern Italian setting with modern-looking people and fashion (eye glasses) 2. Pre-modern Italian setting with multi-ethnic, non-Italian-named people 3. Not yet finding the ""need"" for building the windmill and tasting room  The first two break the theme for me, really.

futhee,10,"Holy sweet mother of god, this is a hard game when played solitaire.  The regular rules for the Automa are fairly simple, but the campaign play rules are tough!  The different challenges definitely force you to adapt your strategy and try different ways to win.    I've read that some people have a problem with the luck of the draw of the cards, and yes, that can affect you, especially when playing solo.  My one play with other players (4-player game), however, I probably had the worst cards, but it was fun trying to get around that.  It's early on during the development of Automa decks, but this simple one might be one of the best.  The campaign challenges vary greatly, and there are almost no Automa rules to remember during the game.  Outstanding, and bumps my rating of the game to a 10.  Solo high score: 23  Campaign Play: Challenge 1: 3 tries (successful) Challenge 2: 1 try (successful) - woohoo! Challenge 3: 5 tries (successful - argh - a tie in the 3rd game) Challenge 4: 1 try (successful) Challenge 5: 1 try",183394,,0.9931,positive,80,19,0

farsidehobbes,10,"See comments about Viticulture.  This version was tailor-made for me.  Everything I like about Viticulture and most of the Tuscany expansions that I like in 1 box.  It really is the 'essential' edition of Viticulture.  By far, my favorite worker placement game (as of March 2016).  March 2016: Finally played solo and it delivers.  Took two tries to win against the Automa deck, but it was tight both times.  Further solo plays confirm that solo can be quite difficult as it usually comes down to the very last turn to win.  Oct 2016: Played with the Structures expansion (which I bought alacarte) using a 4 card draft at the start, although I don't count the cards against your hand limit.  Definitely added a lot of great variety.  Will always use this expansion.  Skip the draft and just deal out 4 to everyone, they can discard and draw a replacement if the structure deals with stars.  Those cards don't count against your hand size limit.  Sept 2018: I still love this game.  I did print out a snippet of the Tuscany board that has the Sell wine action on it, as my one criticism is that it can sometimes be very hard to get points if you don't get orders that match your wine.  I haven't played with that additional action yet, so we'll see how that goes.  May 2020: Played with my printed out Sell Wine action spot and it added just enough variety.  One more way to earn a few points.",183394,,0.99,positive,80,19,0

cbazler,10,"When the ""slave controversy"" first broke out, I was one of this game's biggest critics. I really wanted to try it because I knew this was my kind of game, but I also knew most of my friends would refuse to play. Since the slaves contribute absolutely nothing to the fun or thematic flavor of the game, I made [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/108201/replacements-slave-cards-camels]replacements for the slave cards[/url], and finally got my slave-free copy to the table.  And I'm so glad I did! This game presents some of the most dizzyingly complex and difficult decisions in a short time, with a very simple and elegant rule set that you can teach to just about anyone. Each game will be very different because everything in the setup (cards, tiles, meeples) is randomized, but otherwise the game is otherwise mostly open information. It manages to be both non-confrontational and incredibly competitive at the same time, providing an amazingly tense game experience.

Lots of different ways to score points; the resource marketplace in particular lends itself toward specialization; there isn't enough time to do everything. On every turn there are so many tasty options, and lots of fun consequences of each move. My turns are fun even if I think I'm losing.  The variable board geography and seeding, and the randomized djinns, keeps the game fresh.  With The Artisans of Naqala expansion, the addition of artisans and items forces players more than ever to specialize. The chasm, mountains, and tents don't add much.

ovis,10,"This very quickly became an absolute favorite.   I think it is amazing as a 2 player game. Yes, back-to-back turn are much more common and even more is possible, but it's part of the game to make people pay a lot for getting them. Back-to-back turns also allow for nice combinations where you can set yourself up, which to us does not even increase the time a turn takes as you have to look for what you wanna do and what you leave behind is a question for every turn not just back-to-back turns.   Yes, I can see some people having AP problems here, but we don't have them much. Due to the game being very abstract with all information open, one can always study the board while it's another persons turn and even though it may change a lot when others took there turn, it's something that keeps us very interested and which gives already a good ""feeling"" of the state of the board. Especially certain Dschinns also give you a direction for a more long term strategy, which makes finding good moves a little more ""directed"". From time to time a turn can last a little longer, but in this game we just don't have a big issue with this.   It also does have a learning curve to it. After a couple of games, certain ""patterns"" for good moves became more obvious for us, reducing playtime quiet a bit.   I also love the fact that one can go very different strategies and still end up with a close result. I'm not always a fan of point salads, but here for me it just works, because it is tied together with this really great mancala mechanic. ",157354,,0.9913,positive,71,15,1

tazzietiger,10,"I'm so enamored by this game! I can't stop thinking about it. I got to learn the game at Gen Con, me and my friend waited by Bruno's table so we could learn from him and both him and the game were a blast. Who knew how hilarious Bruno was? Me and my friend waited by the doors three hours before they opened the next day to rush in and be one of the first 50 to get the game and get it signed, another treat! Though I felt bad getting it signed in front of a line of people that was just behind us and was getting told the game sold out... we should have maybe waited to get it signed haha.   Anyways I have played the game as often as I could since I got back home and I love it so much. There is so many interesting things to do every turn and it feels so satisfying to make big plays. The rules are very easy to teach and it seems that right away people are making strategic and clever plays. I thought the game could have some AP problems but have never found any issue with the game taking any longer than around an hour. The bidding at the beginning of each turn is so interesting as this is really where the champion of the game is made. Every bit of design feels so clever and tied in with every other element, like the cards not being replaced immediately as they are purchases. This mirrors the rest of the game as decisions diminish each round. This ties back into the bid for turn order being so important. If you want to do something that turn bid high, as it may be gone before you get to it. But getting to something immediately doesn't make the game for you either, if you see no good move, or you got outbid, the layout is ever changing as every player before you manipulates the board and cards until your turn and a great turn can arise out of that. Its a very tactical game and with the Djinns and some of the scoring elements, especially with the sets of cards and yellow meeples, it is a strategic game too.   I really can't say enough good things about the game. With more plays I may move the game to a ten even, something I don't do lightly! Bruno, if you read this I want to think you personally for the great opportunity to learn this game from you and for the hours of wonderful fun the game provides me and my friends.

burnstar,10,"10x10 2015. This game takes about 3 or 4 plays to click but after it does, it becomes really good.  The first few plays I felt a little lost and there seem like there a ton of Djinns adding randomness.  But after a few plays you start to see the available moves and can evaluate them more quickly and the Djinns start coming up repeatedly and become well known.  The game is pretty tactical, you want to take the best move available while not giving easy moves to your opponent.  Chaining together moves and planning turns in advance is difficult, if not impossible, because your opponents will inevitably make unpredictable moves and take moves you didn't see.  Still, there is some long term strategy here in utilizing your Djninns, committing (or not) to collecting sets of resources, and trying (or not) to get the most viziers.  Initially, I thought variety seemed to be the way to go, and indeed if you have a really good move in front of you you should take it even if it doesn't fit with your plans.  But recently I've tried pursuing one or two goals with more focus from the beginning and found that to be a viable way to play too.  Anyway, the more I play the more awesome this gets- great game.",157354,,0.9905,positive,71,15,1

Vyking,10,"Really enjoyable with multiple scoring routes. Only downside is prolonged periods of AP, especially during bidding for turn order (trying to see good moves for yourself) and then when you take your turn (if someone has already moved meeples you had previously planned on using).",157354,,0.624,positive,71,15,1

caltexn,10,"An easy 10. A clever change of mechanic, with worker DIS-placement a nice change of pace. Highly tactical with the fluid meeple board movement, so each turn offers new opportunities, offering the challenge to choose the right course. Bidding for turn order is interesting, where players must choose how many points to invest versus the offered rewards. Yet the key here is finding a complementary movement, to temper your desire to bid too high for that optimal move. Brilliant design, fun gameplay, thematic, and gameplay that goes just the right distance. Outstanding.",157354,,0.9833,positive,71,15,1
